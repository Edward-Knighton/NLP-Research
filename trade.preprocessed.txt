   __label__intro;  Good morning. During today's hearing, we will examine the proposed Free Trade Agreement with those countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic. This would immediately liberalize two-way trade. We currently have a one-way trade arrangement; this will liberalize two-way trade. The Chair wishes to thank and acknowledge the countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, along with the Dominican Republic, because there was precondition that they agree as a region before the U.S. would negotiate with them.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__exports;  It is important to note that in May of 2000, 309 House Members voted to give these same countries we've been mentioning unilateral preferential treatment by
    __label__jobs __label__fdi __label__democratization;  The DR–CAFTA countries combined make up the 2nd-largest U.S. market in Latin America. Enhanced trade with these nations—as we'll hear in testimony from most of the witness and we will examine in detail their arguments—will create new jobs for Americans and new partnerships in the region. The agreement covers all agricultural and industrial sectors and contains strong protections for U.S. investors. In addition to the commercial opportunities, DR–CAFTA will help cement many of the recent democratic, legal and economic reforms in these countries.
    __label__nonrel;  The Chair is often amazed at the short memories of many people. I believe some testimony will point out that just a few short years ago, the U.S. interest in the region stemmed more from concerns of humanitarian, national security and other arguments, rather than the very positive question we have before us today.
   __label__laborrights __label__position;   It's a little bewildering to the Chair to have previous Free Trade Agreements supported by a number of people who are now opposing this one because the concerns over labor protections really would apply, in the Chair's opinion, a "double standard." In fact, the labor provisions in this agreement are stronger than in prior agreements, such as Morocco, Chile and Singapore. The arguments of an absolutist nature, in terms of the unfairness of this agreement, are belied by the examination of agreements just in the last few years, let alone those of several years ago.
    __label__position;  This is one of the strongest Free Trade Agreements to come before Congress, and I assume that we're going to move fairly quickly to agreement. There has been a major build-up and the Chair hopes for a positive, informative and enlightening discussion before the Committee today.
  __label__intro;  Ambassador ALLGEIER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank you and Congressman Rangel and all the Members of this Committee for the opportunity today to present to you the FTA between the United States and the CAFTA countries and the Dominican Republic. We greatly appreciate the guidance that the Committee has provided throughout this negotiating process, and in particular we appreciate the leadership of you, Mr. Chairman, and Congressman Rangel. The DR—CAFTA marks the successful cul-
   __label__position __label__exports;  The DR–CAFTA is not an act of unilateral altruism by the United States. We have much to gain by this agreement. Collectively, as you pointed out, Mr. Chairman, Central America and the Dominican Republic make up the second largest U.S. export market in Latin America. It is larger than our exports to Brazil, but, interestingly, on a global scale, the exports that we have to these countries exceeds the total exports that we have to Russia, India, and Indonesia combined. The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) has estimated that U.S. farm exports under DR–CAFTA would increase by $1.5 billion a year. That is an effective doubling of the agricultural exports that we have at present, $1.8 billion. The interesting thing is that the agricultural exports, our agricultural exports, would grow at an 8 to 1 ratio compared to our agricultural imports from these countries. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also has done an analysis of the DR–CAFTA and it estimates for all goods, our exports to that region would increase by $3 billion a year.
   __label__exports __label__forbarriersred __label__iprights __label__govprocure;  We currently face an unlevel playingfield. We do have free trade with Central America and the Dominican Republic in one direction. Nearly 80 percent of the imports into the United States from these countries enter the United States duty free. About 40 percent of our exports to those countries enter those countries duty free. In agriculture, it is even more dramatic. Approximately 99 percent of the agricultural products that we import from these countries enter our markets duty free. Now, more than half of current U.S. farm exports to Central America will become duty free on the first day of this agreement. That includes products such as high-quality cuts of beef, cotton, wheat, key fruits and vegetables, soybeans, and processed food products. There will be additional market opening for pork, dry beans, vegetable oil, poultry, rice, corn, and dairy products. That is the reason that every major agricultural organization, with one exception—that is more than 60 organizations—have already indicated their strong support for the DR–CAFTA. In services we also will be getting important new opportunities in this region covering the whole spectrum of services: telecommunications, banking, insurance, audio-visual services, transportation, engineering, express delivery, computer and related services, and on and on. This also is a trade agreement for the digital age. It provides strong protection for our intellectual property in the copyright areas of software, music, text and videos, but also in patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. The agreement provides strong anticorruption procedures and provisions in government contracting, government procurement, and in other areas of trade with these countries.
	 __label__jobs __label__;  Textiles and apparel is an important component of our trade with this region. It is our second-largest market for U.S. fabric and yarns. The DR—CAFTA represents a critical element in our domestic industries' ability to compete with Asia. Without the tariff preferences and rules of origin of DR—CAFTA, apparel companies may well lose production to China, where they will be much more likely to use inputs from outside the United States. Just to put an order of magnitude on that, when we purchase apparel from China, on average 0.1 percent of that apparel, the value of that apparel, involves inputs from the United States. When we import, on the other hand, apparel from Central America, the Dominican Republic, 71 percent of the content of that is from the United States. The DR—CAFTA is essential for us to keep our customers for U.S. yarn and fabric and to maintain U.S. jobs in this sector.
   __label__nonrel;  With respect to labor, obviously there is considerable interest in this Committee with regard to worker rights and labor standards in Central America. We share that goal of seeing the continuation of real, meaningful improvements in worker rights in the region. In DR—CAFTA, within the agreement itself, we focus our attention and our efforts on the chief problem, which is the need to improve enforcement of domestic labor laws in these countries. The Central American countries, and later the Dominican Republic, requested a study by the ILO of the labor situation in their countries. The ILO study demonstrated that the labor laws on the books in Central America and the Dominican Republic are in line with the ILO core labor standards. However, let us be clear: The enforcement of labor laws in the region needs more attention and resources. The Central Americans and the Dominicans themselves acknowledge this. They, with the assistance of the Inter-American Development Bank, produced this white paper on the labor situation in their countries. It is a very candid, thorough, analysis of the labor situation in these countries. What it points out is that the most important issue to be addressed is the one of enforcement.
   __label__enforcement __label__laborrights;  Within the DR—CAFTA we have a three-pronged strategy for dealing with this issue. First, the agreement requires that countries not fail to effectively enforce their labor laws. As the New York Times said in an editorial on November 24 of last year, "CAFTA actually goes further than the pact with Jordan, since penalty fines collected for not enforcing labor laws would be sent back to the offending country to fix the offense." Let me add, the use of those fines is subject to the agreement of the United States. The second part of our strategy is that the countries have already taken numerous concrete steps to improve labor law enforcement, even during the negotiations increasing labor inspectors, appointing special labor prosecutors, and making a number of other changes in their practices. Finally, we see the need to provide assistance to these countries to build the capacity to enforce their laws more effectively and to strengthen their enforcement infrastructure and institutions. The Department of Labor has committed $7.7 million to a multiyear effort. The Congress has appropriated $20 million for us to support capacity building in these countries in labor and the environment. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has obligated $2 million to launch a project on continuous improvement in the Central Amer-
  __label__environment __label__enforcement;  Quickly on the environment, environment also breaks new ground. We have included several innovations in this agreement. Working with Senator Baucus, for example, we have developed a new public submissions mechanism that will allow the interested public in these countries, including Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), to put forward, to challenge, a party's failure to enforce their environmental laws. This innovation has been recognized by environmentalists in Central America. Ten Central American environmental NGOs sent a letter to former Trade Representative Zoellick indicating their strong support for this agreement and particularly this public submission process that I mentioned. As with labor, there is a strong component of capacity building and also a strong component of cooperation in the form of an environmental cooperation agreement.
  __label__outro __label__position;  Mr. Chairman, the last 20 years has been a very difficult road to democracy for these countries, but today we have neighbors in Central America and the Dominican Republic who want to trade goods, not guns, across their border; who want to replace chaos with commerce. They want to use the DR—CAFTA as an important tool of reform; to help deepen and strengthen their democracies. Working closely with the Congress, we have negotiated a landmark FTA. We believe that the DR—CAFTA meets the objectives set by Congress in the Trade Act. It is strongly in the economic and national interests of the United States. We hope that the Congress will agree that America should not turn its back on these struggling democracies that want a closer economic relationship with us, that will benefit our citizens and their citizens. The DR—CAFTA makes imminent sense for America, for Central America, and for the Dominican Republic. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
   __label__intro;  Chairman Thomas, Congressman Rangel, and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to have the opportunity to testify before you today on the free trade agreement with Central America and the Dominican Republic, or CAFTA. As I have stated before in this room on several occasions, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative greatly appreciates the hard work of this Committee, and I commend in particular Chairman Thomas and Congressman Rangel for their leadership on trade matters.
   __label__nonrel;  I would like to begin today with a bit of historical context. Twenty years ago, Congress held several hearings on the topic of Central America. But the Administration witnesses were not from USTR, and the topics had little to do with economics. In February 1985, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing about developments in Guatemala, where an undemocratic military government ruled and civil war raged. The following month, the House heard testimony from Pentagon and State Department officials about U.S. military assistance to El Salvador, which was then fighting an armed Communist insurgency. In 1985, to the extent that Congress or the American people paid attention to Central America, it was largely because of violence, dictatorships, and civil war.
   __label__nonrel;  It is an extraordinary sign of the progress made in Central America that we meet here today—twenty years later—to discuss a free trade agreement—an economic partnership with these countries. Today, the Dominican Republic and the nations of Central America are all democracies. Elected leaders are embracing freedom and economic reform, fighting corruption, strengthening the rule of law and battling crime, and supporting America in the war on terrorism. And they want to help ce-
    __label__democratization __label__alliance;  CAFTA marks the successful culmination of a decades-long American policy of promoting economic reform and democracy in Central America. President Bush strongly believes that America should stand with those in our Hemisphere—and the world—who stand for economic freedom. CAFTA offers us the best opportunity to strengthen the economic ties we already have with these nations, and to reinforce their progress toward economic, political and social reform.
    __label__forbarriersred;  But CAFTA is not an act of unilateral altruism on the part of the United States. We have much to gain from this trade agreement: access to a large and growing market of 45 million consumers close to our border, an opportunity to level the playing field for American workers and farmers who today must cope with one-way free trade from Central America and the Dominican Republic without a reciprocal chance to compete.
    __label__process;  The agreement that we are here to consider today is the result of over three years of hard work and close cooperation between the Administration and the Congress, which began when President Bush announced his intent to negotiate a free trade agreement with Central America in January 2002. Using guidance from Trade Promotion Authority, USTR formally consulted closely with committees of jurisdiction before and after every round of negotiations, shared proposed text of the agreement with staff and Members prior to presenting texts in the negotiations. Former USTR Robert Zoellick, myself, and our chief negotiators consulted with the Congressional Oversight Group and with Members on an individual basis. We took all views into consideration during each step of the negotiations, and greatly value the input provided by the Congress for this agreement. Our dialog with the Congress continues today, and I welcome this opportunity to talk with all Members about CAFTA.
    __label__process;  In concluding this FTA, our objective, which we feel confident that we have met, was to follow the negotiating objectives laid out by Congress in the bipartisan Trade Act of 2002 to strike a comprehensive and commercially meaningful agreement that will benefit U.S. workers, businesses, farmers, investors and consumers. At the same time, these complex negotiations took careful consideration of import sensitivities of the United States, many of which were communicated to us by Members of Congress. We worked hard to take into account all concerns raised with us by Members of Congress, and believe that we struck careful balances to reflect these interests.
    __label__position;  So today I would like to discuss the reasons why we believe CAFTA is strongly in the national interest of the United States, and why we want to work with Congress to pass this trade agreement into law.
    __label__exports;  Central America and the Dominican Republic are very large export markets for the United States. Collectively, these countries make up the second largest U.S. export market in Latin America, with more than $15.7 billion in U.S. exports in 2004. For some key states, for example Florida and North Carolina, the region is a top-three export destination for Made-in-USA products. Central America and the Dominican Republic form a larger export market than Brazil, a larger export market than Australia, and a larger export market than Russia, India and Indonesia combined.
    __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  While the Central America countries and the Dominican Republic are physically small, they are clearly large markets for U.S. products and services. The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates CAFTA could expand U.S. farm exports by $1.5 billion a year, which would represent nearly a doubling of our current agricultural exports to the region. Manufacturers would also benefit, especially in sectors such as information technology products, agricultural and construction equipment, paper products, pharmaceuticals, and medical and scientific equipment. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has done a number of studies of the potential economic impact of CAFTA in just eight key U.S. states, and estimates that U.S. sales to the region would expand by more than $3 billion in the first year of CAFTA. From soft drinks to software, from pork to paper products, the region is a voracious consumer of U.S. products and services. In some areas, textile yarn and fabric for example, the region is second only to Mexico as a worldwide consumer of U.S. exports.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__fdi;  But while these Central American countries and the Dominican Republic buy many goods and services from the United States, we currently face an unlevel playing field. Most Americans probably do not realize that we already have free trade with Central America and the Dominican Republic, but it is one-way free trade. Under unilateral preference programs begun by President Reagan and expanded under President Clinton with broad bipartisan support, nearly 80 percent of imports from Central America and the Dominican Republic already enter the United States duty-free. In agriculture, that percentage is even higher: we estimate that 99% of Central America's and the Dominican Republic's farm exports to the United States are duty-free. For the countries of the region, CAFTA will lock in those benefits and expand on them, helping to promote U.S. investment in the region.
   __label__forbarriersred;  But more importantly, CAFTA will level the playing field for American workers and farmers. It will further open regional markets to our products and services, which currently face very high average tariffs or non-tariff barriers. For example, today the average Central American applied tariff on motor vehicles is 11.1%, while U.S. applied tariffs on imports from Central America are zero. The regional tariff on steel averages 16.3%, but the U.S. tariff is zero. The regional tariff on chemicals is 12.8%, but the U.S. tariff is zero. The same situation exists in agriculture: Central American and Dominican tariffs on U.S. vegetables faced a tariff ranging from 15 % to 47%; ours are zero. U.S. fruits and nuts faced a tariff as high as 25% while products in this same sector enter our market duty free. The chief effect of CAFTA is not to further open our market, but rather to tear down barriers to our products and services in Central America and the Dominican Republic.
   __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  CAFTA will create new opportunities for U.S. workers and manufacturers. More than 80 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial goods will become duty-free immediately, with remaining tariffs phased out over 10 years.
   __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  The agreement will also expand markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers. More than half of current U.S. farm exports to Central America will become duty-free immediately, including high quality cuts of beef, cotton, wheat, soybeans, key fruits and vegetables, and processed food products among others. Tariffs on most remaining U.S. farm products will be phased out within 15 years. U.S. farm products that will benefit from improved market access include pork, dry beans, vegetable oil, poultry, rice, corn, and dairy products. It is significant that every major U.S. farm commodity group but one has stated its strong support for CAFTA.
   __label__forbarriersred;  In the important area of services, the Dominican Republic and the Central American countries will accord substantial market access across their entire services regime, offering new access in sectors such as telecommunications, express delivery, computer and related services, tourism, energy, transport, construction and engineering, financial services, insurance, audio/visual and entertainment, professional, environmental, and other sectors. The Dominican Republic and the Central Americancountries made significant commitments regarding their "dealer protection" regimes. These commitments will help ensure that U.S. firms are not locked into exclusive or uneconomical distributor arrangements.
   __label__iprights;  This is also a trade agreement for the digital age, providing state-of-the-art protections and non-discriminatory treatment for digital products such as U.S. software, music, text, and videos. Protections for U.S. patents, trademarks and trade secrets are strengthened, and several are Chile-plus provisions, such as strong patent protection by 2007 for certain modified plant varieties.
   __label__govprocure __label__transparency;  And this agreement breaks new ground, providing strong anti-corruption measures in government contracting and other matters affecting international trade or investment. U.S. firms are guaranteed a fair and transparent process to sell goods and services to a wide range of Central American and Dominican Republic government entities. The agreement's dispute settlement mechanisms call for open public hearings, public access to documents, and the opportunity for third parties to submit views, with limited exceptions to protect confidential information. Transparency in customs operations will aid express delivery shipments and will require more open and public processes for customs rulings and administration.
   __label__impcomp __label__sourcing;  Textiles and apparel is an important component of our trade with the region and deserves special mention. The Administration strongly believes that CAFTA is not a threat to U.S. textile producers but in fact represents a critical element in our domestic industry's ability to compete with Asia.
   __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  Today, garment factories in Central America and the Dominican Republic are very large consumers of U.S.-made textile fabric and yarn. The extensive use of U.S. inputs in the regional apparel business means that Central America and the Dominican Republic actually constitute the second-largest world export market for U.S. textile yarn and fabric, behind only Mexico. For states like North Carolina, exports of textile fabric and yarn to garment makers in the region make a small country like Honduras that state's number one export market in the world. CAFTA will help keep it that way, by delivering tariff preference benefits for clothing made in the region that uses U.S. yarn and fabric.
    __label__jobs __label__position __label__sourcing;  Without CAFTA, our domestic yarn and textile industry would likely lose one of its biggest customers. Worldwide quotas on textiles and apparel expired at the end of last year, meaning that the hemispheric industry faces a new collective threat from Asia. Without the tariff preference benefits of CAFTA, apparel companies may well move production to China. Indeed, the uncertainty to date about CAFTA has already caused a number of apparel firms to shut down operations in Central America and move them to China; as many as 10,000 workers may already have already lost their jobs. In China, there are no special trade incentives for apparel producers to buy U.S. yarn and fabric. In fact, they are much more likely to buy inputs from Asian suppliers, rather than producers here Z in the United States. That's why a T-shirt that is Made in Honduras is likely to contain well over 50% U.S. content, while a T-shirt Made in China is likely to contain very little U.S. content at all. To keep our customers for U.S. yarn and fabric, we need to keep them close to home. And to keep them close to home, we need to pass CAFTA soon.
    __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  I know that there is considerable interest on the Committee with regard to worker rights and labor standards in Central America and the Dominican Republic. We share that interest, and I believe we share the goal of seeing the continuation of real, meaningful improvements in worker rights in the region. I believe we should focus our strategy, and our attention and efforts, on the chief problem in these countries: the need to improve enforcement of domestic labor laws.
    __label__nonrel;  The Central American countries, and later the Dominican Republic, requested a study by the International Labor Organization (ILO) of the labor situation in their countries. The ILO study demonstrated that labor laws on the books in Central America and the Dominican Republic, are generally in line with ILO core labor standards. The Administration's own, more detailed analysis of the labor rights situation in these six countries confirms that their labor laws are generally ILO-consistent. Indeed, labor protections on the books in the region are broadly similar to labor laws in Morocco, and in some areas (e.g., child labor) are stronger. Congress gave broad bipartisan support to an FTA with Morocco in 2004.
    __label__enforcement __label__laborrights;  But let's be clear: the enforcement of labor laws in the region needs more attention and resources. Our analysis shows this, and the Central Americans and Dominicans themselves acknowledge this, as the White Paper recently released by regional Labor and Trade Ministers clearly demonstrates. CAFTA is specifically designed to respond to the problem at hand by improving enforcement and expanding resources with a comprehensive, three-part strategy:
 __label__enforcement __label__laborrights;  * First, the agreement requires that countries not fail to effectively enforce their labor laws. If they consistently fail to enforce those laws in a manner that affects our trade, then they face the prospect of monetary penalties that will be directed to solve the problem, or potentially face the loss of preferential trade benefits. As the New York Times said in an editorial on November 24, 2004, "Cafta actually goes further than the pact with Jordan, since penalty fines collected for not enforcing labor laws would be sent back to the offending country to fix the offense." Exactly right.
 __label__enforcement __label__laborrights;  * * Second, it's important to note that countries in the region have already taken numerous, concrete steps to improve labor law enforcement, including hiring more labor inspectors, appointing special labor prosecutors, prosecuting perpetrators of violence against trade unionists, and cutting the backlog of cases in their labor courts. There is much more to do, however. So we were pleased that Labor and Trade Ministers recently announced a series of additional and specific recommendations to further improve labor law enforcement.
 __label__enforcement __label__laborrights;  * * Finally, we need to provide assistance to build the capacity of these countries to enforce their laws more effectively and to strengthen their enforcement institutions and infrastructure. We're pleased that the Department of Labor committed $7.7 million to a multi-year technical assistance effort. Congress has now appropriated $20 million for FY05 for "labor cooperation, capacity building on fundamental labor rights and the elimination of child labor, and improvement in labor administration", as well as for important environmental cooperation activities in this region. The Administration intends to work with the Congress and with the CAFTA countries to target these funds toward the areas of greatest need, and we hope that the funds provided for FY05 are only a first step in an ongoing commitment by the Congress to fund labor capacity-building in this region.
    __label__jobs __label__growth;  * Our comprehensive strategy does not attempt to minimize the challenges we faced: We negotiated a fully TPA-consistent labor chapter, we worked with the Dominican Republic and the Central American countries to make real worker rights progress during the negotiations, and there is a strategy for long-term capacity building. This concrete, real-world effort is directed at where the problem lies: problems with the enforcement of existing laws in Central America and the Dominican Republic. By contrast, a strategy of defeating CAFTA would preserve the status quo, and very likely set back progress to date. Defeating CAFTA will do nothing to improve working conditions for a single worker in Central America or the Dominican Republic, and in fact will have the opposite effect, as tens of thousands of Central Americans and Dominicans stand to lose their jobs to China if the United States turns its back on CAFTA. We believe that one of the best ways to improve working conditions in Central America and the Dominican Republic is to have strong economic growth, combined with a comprehensive and targeted strategy to build the capacity of these countries to enforce their labor laws.
    __label__environment;  We have also broken new ground on the environment side. I believe that the CAFTA environmental provisions, and the associated Environmental Cooperation Agreement, are the most forward-leaning trade and environment package ever. We have worked closely with Congress in developing our approach and developing many of its unique features.
    __label__environment __label__transparency;  The CAFTA countries have come a long way in the last decade in putting in place good environmental laws as well as the beginning of a complete environmental legal regime, but enforcement in many cases remains a significant challenge. There is also the need for greater transparency and involvement of civil society in environmental decision-making. To address these concerns, in addition to continuing existing Administration efforts to help the CAFTA countries further develop their legal regimes, we have included several innovations in the environment package:
 __label__environment __label__enforcement;  * First, we have developed a new public submissions mechanism that will allow the interested public, including NGOs, an opportunity to challenge a Party's failure to enforce its environmental laws and to obtain an independent review of their submissions. CAFTA is the first trade agreement ever to include this kind of mechanism in its core provisions, and it will give civil society in the region a new voice in working to improve environmental enforcement in the region. Just a few weeks ago, in a ceremony taking place at the Organization of American States, we and our Central American and Dominican Republic counterparts signed a landmark agreement that designates a new environmental unit within SIECA—the Organization for Central American Economic Integration—as the secretariat to implement these provisions.
 __label__environment;  * Second, the parallel environmental cooperation agreement (also signed at the OAS ceremony) builds on previous capacity-building efforts in the region, but breaks new ground in several ways. For the first time ever, the agreement provides for the establishment of short-, medium- and long-term benchmarks for measuring progress in meeting environmental goals. The agreement also provides for independent monitoring by outside organizations of success in meeting these benchmarks. Initial priority areas for cooperation include reinforcing capacity to implement and enforce environmental laws, including habitat conservation, trade in endangered species and treatment of hazardous wastes.
 __label__environment;  * Finally, we are taking steps to ensure that capacity building efforts are adequately funded. The Administration has initiated a Deputies process to oversee environmental cooperation efforts linked with all the FTAs and to organize an inter-agency budget process to promote coordination across interested federal agencies. The Administration also is considering how to allocate the $20 million in FY05 funding between labor and environment activities.
    __label__environment;  The response in the region is already gratifying. Last month ten Central American NGOs sent a letter to former U.S. Trade Representative Zoellick and the trade ministers of our Central American and Dominican Republic partners, expressing their support for the CAFTA and urging its passage. These groups praised the CAFTA environmental package and the opportunities it provides for them to have a new voice in pressing for environmental progress in the region. The governments are also doing their part to prepare the way for CAFTA's implementation. With our participation, they have held numerous public outreach sessions in the region, with more to follow. And just to take some of the most recent examples of concrete action: Nicaragua has created a new office on trade and environment within its environment ministry as the result of the CAFTA, while El Salvador has established a new advisory committee on trade and environment issues, with NGOs on the committee, very much like our own Trade and Environment Policy Advisory Committee (TEPAC). In fact, the Environment Chapter requires all of the CAFTA–DR countries to establish such advisory committees.
   __label__position;  Thus, we are poised to make a real difference in strengthening civil society and environmental protection in Central America and the Dominican Republic. We should not let this historic opportunity pass.
   __label__impcomp;  We are aware that some Members of Congress have expressed concerns with U.S. sectors that are sensitive to import competition, such as sugar. If I had to describe in a phrase how we handled those issues in the agreement, it would be, "handled with care."
   __label__impcomp __label__dombarriersrem;  On sugar, it is important to remember that there will be no change in the above-quota U.S. duty on sugar. This was an important accomplishment that recognizes the sensitivity of this important sector of the U.S. farm economy. CAFTA will not have a destabilizing effect on the U.S. sugar program, because even with a modest increase under CAFTA, U.S. imports will still fall comfortably below levels set for sugar imports in the Farm Bill.
   __label__nonrel;  In other agreements, we have also been sensitive to this issue. In our FTA with Australia, sugar was excluded entirely. In our agreements with Chile and Morocco, we have provisions that effectively will result in no change in the levels of sugar imports from those nations.
   __label__impcomp;  For Central America and the Dominican Republic we agreed to a very small and very limited expansion of the quota for sugar imports from these countries.
   __label__impcomp __label__dombarriersrem;  The total increased quota amount is equivalent to only about one day's worth of U.S. sugar production. We produce more than 7 million metric tons of sugar in the United States annually. The increased amounts under CAFTA are only a little over 100,000 metric tons. Even after 15 years, increased sugar imports from Central America and the Dominican Republic will amount to only about 1.7% of U.S. consumption.
   __label__nonrel;  In addition, the Agreement includes a mechanism that allows the United States, at our option, to provide alternative compensation to CAFTA country exporters in place of imports of sugar.
   __label__impcomp;  To put sugar imports under CAFTA into perspective, the increased imports in the first year under CAFTA amount to about a teaspoon and half per week per American. That compares with average consumption of 10-20 teaspoons of added sugar per day for most Americans. The amount of sugar allowed into the United States under CAFTA is minuscule. Claims that the CAFTA will harm the U.S. sugar industry are simply wrong.
   __label__democratization;  Mr. Chairman, the last twenty years has been a sometimes difficult road to democracy in El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and other countries in the region. But today we have neighbors in Central America and the Dominican Republic who want to trade goods, not guns, across their borders. They want to replace chaos with commerce, and to use CAFTA as an important tool of reform that will help deepen and strengthen democracy.
   __label__outro __label__position;  Working closely with the Congress, we have negotiated a landmark free trade agreement that will open these large and growing markets to our goods and services. CAFTA will level the playing field, helping our workers and farmers sell to countries that already enjoy virtually unlimited access to the United States market. The agreement will help the U.S. textile industry unite with some of its largest world customers to better compete against imports from China and other Asian competitors. It contains a focused, results-oriented strategy that will—when combined with a strong Congressional commitment to capacity-building—produce real improvements in working conditions and environmental protection in the region. And it handles sensitive commodities with great care.
   __label__outro __label__position;  We believe CAFTA meets the objectives set by Congress in the Trade Act. It is strongly in the economic and national interests of the United States. We hope the Congress will agree that America should not turn its back on struggling democracies that want a closer economic relationship that will benefit workers in all our countries. CAFTA makes eminent sense for America, and for Central America and the Dominican Republic.
   __label__intro __label__position;  Mr. MCGRAW. Thank you Mr. Chairman, Congressman Rangel, and Members of the Committee. Good afternoon. I am Terry McGraw, and I am Chairman, President, and CEO of McGraw-Hill companies. I am here today on behalf of the Business Roundtable, the Emergency Committee for American Trade and the Business Coalition for U.S.-Central America Trade. We strongly support the prompt congressional approval of DR—CAFTA, which will advance our economic, regional, and foreign policy interests. Now, given our time constraints this afternoon, let me quickly talk about five, just five different key benefits of DR—CAFTA.
   __label__exports;  First, DR—CAFTA countries represent an important and growing market. As we have been hearing, U.S. exports to the six DRCAFTA countries in 2004 equaled 515.7 billion, making these countries the second-largest U.S. export market in Latin America, after Mexico; the 12th largest U.S. export market worldwide, larger than Russia, India, and Indonesia combined; and poised for growth, given DR—CAFTA's proximity and close partnership with our country. With overall trade of $33.4 billion in 2004, once implemented, DR—CAFTA will be the United States' second-largest FTA of overall trade flow after NAFTA.
   __label__forbarriersred;  My second point, Mr. Chairman, is that DR—CAFTA will obviously level the playingfield by opening markets for U.S. workers and farmers. Some 75 percent of the DR—CAFTA imports and 99 percent of DR—CAFTA agriculture products already enter the United States duty-free, and this is through the preference programs Congress approved on a bipartisan basis. This agreement will lock in and expand those benefits. The DR—CAFTA will make trade with our neighbors a two-way street. The DR—CAFTA will open their markets to our farm and industrial goods and our services, eliminating high tariffs, tariff rate quotas, and non-tariff barriers.
   __label__laborrights __label__environment;  Third, DR—CAFTA will promote strong labor and environmental protection. Simply put, it is economic growth that is the single most important driver for improved labor and environmental conditions. The DR—CAFTA will promote economic growth, increase transparency and accountability, enhance the investment climate, and promote stability, creating new opportunities for workers and increasing demand for better labor and environmental protection. This is particularly important given the textile and apparel sector, which is the second-largest employer overall in these six countries, providing some of the better-paying jobs in the region, where subsistence farming engages the largest segment of the working population. Without DR—CAFTA, these jobs will increasingly be lost, bringing increased poverty in a region where nearly half the population today lives in abject poverty.
   __label__laborrights __label__environment;  Beyond the economic growth opportunities, DR—CAFTA promotes the labor and environmental objectives Congress called for in the Trade Act of 2002. It incorporates binding commitments subject to dispute settlement, and each of the countries will enforce its labor and environmental laws as well as the most robust labor and environmental capacity-building mechanisms of any U.S. FTA. Though some labor laws in some DR—CAFTA countries could be enhanced, what they have enacted includes many strong protections. We should recognize that the progress that they have made in a very short period of time is substantive and that the commitments they have recently made to go even further are welcome.
   __label__growth __label__democratization;  My fourth point, Mr. Chairman, is that DR—CAFTA will help promote economic growth, bolster democracy and the rule of law. The DR—CAFTA will play a positive role in promoting stability and the United States' own security in a region that we all know was wracked by violence and civil war only two decades ago. By promoting economic opportunity and growth, DR—CAFTA will help alleviate poverty, and promote stability in our own neighborhood.
   __label__usleadership;  Fifth and finally, DR—CAFTA is absolutely vital, vital to signaling continued U.S. support for global trade negotiations. Congressional approval of DR—CAFTA will bolster U.S. leadership on trade and create new partners in the developing world. Approval will also promote forward momentum on trade at a critical time in the WTO's Doha negotiations and will help to create much needed momentum for the FTAA negotiations. Failing to approve DRCAFTA would be a particularly destructive message to our regional neighbors and would send a very negative signal to the world that the United States is retreating from its historic role as a leader in promoting liberalized international trade and investment policies and as a leader in a region that is strategically important to us.
   __label__outro;  In sum, DR—CAFTA is more than just another trade agreement. While it is not a panacea, it is the logical next step in America's historic commitment to promote economic growth, advance market-based reforms, promote stability, and improve standards of living. Approval of DR—CAFTA will also send a powerful message to the rest of the world that regional and multilateral trade agreements should be pursued and will promise a more open and fair system to promote commerce among nations. I urge the Committee to support the approval and the implementation of this agreement. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    __label__intro;  Mr. Chairman, Congressman Rangel, Members of the Committee. Good morning. My name is Terry McGraw, Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies.
    __label__intro __label__position;  I welcome the opportunity to appear before you today to express strong support for the U.S.-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) not only on behalf of the McGraw-Hill companies, but also as Chairman of the Emergency Committee for American Trade (ECAT) and Chairman of the International Task Force of the Business Roundtable (Roundtable). I am also appearing before you today on behalf of the Business Coalition for U.S.-Central America Trade, for which ECAT serves as the secretariat and the BRT and others play a leading role.
    __label__intro;  The McGraw-Hill Companies is a global content provider headquartered in New York. We employ 18,000 people in 280 offices in 37 countries worldwide. You know us best through the McGraw-Hill imprint in education, Standard and Poor's, and Business Week. We are members of ECAT, the Business Roundtable and the Business Coalition.
 __label__nonrrel;  * Both ECAT and the BRT are associations of chief executives of major American companies with global operations who represent all principal sectors of the U.S. economy. They are strong champions of strong, commercially-meaningful and comprehensive bilateral, regional and global agreements, such as the NAFTA, the Uruguay Round and the recently-approved free trade agreements—FTAswith Jordan, Chile, Singapore, Australia and Morocco.
 __label__nonrel;  * ECAT was founded more than three decades ago to promote economic growth through expansionary trade and investment policies. Today, the annual sales of ECAT companies total $2 trillion, and the companies employ approximately five and a half million people.
 __label__nonrel;  * The Business Roundtable is committed to advocating public policies that ensure vigorous economic growth, a dynamic global economy, and the well-trained and productive U.S. workforce essential for future competitiveness. Roundtable members employ more than 10 million workers in the United States.
 __label__nonrel;  * The Business Coalition for U.S.-Central America Trade comprises over 400 companies and associations representing all major sectors of the economy with members in all 50 states that have come together to support implementation of the CAFTA. The Business Coalition was formed to support the negotiation of a comprehensive and high standard agreement. Once those negotiations were completed, the Business Coalition has worked to support the implementation of the CAFTA by the U.S. Congress.
    __label__intro;  CAFTA represents a truly comprehensive, commercially meaningful and high standard agreement that has very important economic, development and foreign policy implications for the United States and the six countries involved—Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. It also has important implications for other negotiations that are critically important, from global Doha Development Agenda negotiations ongoing in the World Trade Organization to the negotiations to establish a Free Trade Area of the Americas, which have nearly stalled.
    __label__intro;  My testimony today will focus on five key issues that are critical to the broad-based support of the CAFTA within the U.S. business and agricultural community and the organizations that I represent today:
 __label__alltrade;  1. The commercial importance of the CAFTA countries to the United States.
 __label__forbarriersred;  2. How CAFTA will level the playing field for U.S. farmers, service providers, manufacturers and their workers by moving from a system of unilateral preferences to two-way free trade.
 __label__laborrights __label__environment;  3. The importance of CAFTA in promoting improved working and environmental conditions in the region.
 __label__growth __label__democratization;  4. The importance of CAFTA for promoting economic growth and bolstering democracy and the rule of law in the region.
 __label__usleadership;  5. The importance of CAFTA more broadly in fostering U.S. objectives in global and other regional negotiations.
    __label__exports;  Despite their size and population, U.S. trade with the CAFTA countries is rather striking. In 2004, U.S. exports to the six CAFTA countries equaled $15.7 billion, making these countries:
    __label__exports;  With overall trade of $33.4 billion in 2004, once implemented, CAFTA will be the United States' second largest FTA in terms of overall trade flows, after NAFTA.
    __label__exports;  It is also a market of great potential given its proximity and close partnerships with the United States. U.S. goods appear throughout these countries, in grocery stores to shopping centers. Indeed, U.S. exports already represent about half of each of these countries' imports. As economic growth and new opportunities develop, the markets will attract even greater exports.
    __label__exports __label__growth;  Without even figuring in such growth, the independent U.S. International Trade Commission concluded that U.S. imports would increase by $1.9 billion worldwide as a result of the CAFTA, more than with any other recent FTA partner. A recent report by the National Association of Manufacturers, one of the Business Coalition's members, predicts that CAFTA will help generate $1 billion in new U.S. manufacturing exports. For agriculture, the American Farm Bureau Federation has estimated that U.S. agricultural exports to the CAFTA countries will increase by nearly $900 million
    __label__forbarriersred;  Through unilateral preference programs overwhelmingly approved on a bipartisan basis by Congress since the 1980s, some 75 percent of CAFTA imports and 99 percent of CAFTA agricultural products already enter the United States duty-free. This agreement will lock in those benefits, making them permanent, and expand on them, particularly in the textile and apparel sector which I will discuss momentarily.
    __label__forbarriersred;  But from the point of view of many U.S. businesses, the CAFTA is about making trade with our neighbors more of a two-way street. CAFTA will open their markets to our farm and industrial goods and our services, eliminating high tariffs, tariff rate quotas and non-tariff barriers. Let me quickly identify some of the key areas where CAFTA eliminates barriers:
 __label__forbarriersred __label__exports;  * In the manufacturing sector, CAFTA will provide immediate and tangible benefits. Many U.S. exports to the CAFTA countries currently face tariffs between 10 and 15 percent and, in some cases, more. Upon implementation of the agreement, 80 percent of all U.S. goods exports to the region will become permanently duty-free. In particular, CAFTA will eliminate tariffs immediately on such key products as information technology products, agricultural and construction equipment, paper products, chemicals, and medical and scientific equipment. By year 10, the CAFTA will eliminate all tariffs on all U.S. manufactured goods.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__customs;  CAFTA also eliminates other major non-tariff barriers to consumer and industrial goods, including discriminatory standards, licensing and other barriers. It also includes important provisions to improve customs administration through more transparent, predictable customs operations and processes. Most notably, perhaps, is that the CAFTA—for the first time ever in any free trade agreement—includes substantial commitments to reform and to open up distribution channels that have been restricted for decades by onerous dealer protection barriers. This is particularly important for many consumer goods and information technology producers.
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Beyond manufactured goods, CAFTA expands market access throughout the services sector. Each of the six countries is committed to provide national treatment to U.S. services companies, unless specifically exempted. This "negative list" approach goes far beyond these countries' commitments under the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). As a result, CAFTA will provide important new opportunities for such key U.S. services as banking and other financial services, insurance, telecommunications, distribution, computer, audiovisual and entertainment, energy, transport, construction, and professional services. The six countries also have agreed to significant commitments on regulatory transparency and principles to guide independent regulatory authorities. Of particular importance are Costa Rica's commitments to open up key portions of its currently closed telecommunications and insurance markets, which are important areas of growth for U.S. companies abroad.
 __label__forbarriersred __label__iprights __label__ecommerce;  * CAFTA also creates new opportunities for the U.S. information technology sector. In particular, it requires all parties to eliminate information technology tariffs by joining the WTO's Information Technology Agreement (Costa Rica and El Salvador are already members), open up key information technology services, including telecommunications, include strong intellectual property rights protections and open up distribution channels. The agreement also incorporates important e-commerce provisions that ensure that electronically delivered goods and services receive the same treatment as traditional, physically delivered goods and services, setting an important precedent for global negotiations.
 __label__transparency __label__govprocure;  * CAFTA ensures new access and transparency in growing government procurement markets. While none of the six CAFTA countries are signatories to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, CAFTA commits the parties to many of the same principles. Key commitments that will expand access for U.S. goods and services suppliers include the provision of fair and transparent procurement procedures and national treatment and anti-corruption rules.
 __label__tradedeficits __label__forbarriersred;  * Since 99 percent of CAFTA agricultural imports already enter the United States duty-free, this agreement is critical to provide reciprocity for U.S. farmers. Upon implementation, over half of U.S. agriculture products will enter the Central American and Dominican Republic countries duty-free immediately, with most remaining duties on U.S. products phased out over 15 years. This is important access to a region where the United States is the single largest source of agricultural imports, but faces new competition as other countries enter into preferential arrangements in the region. The new access will be particularly important for:
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Beef products with the immediate elimination of tariffs on high-quality cuts and full elimination over 15 years;
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Pork products with an increase in duty-free quotas for sizeable amounts of U.S. pork over 15 years, after which all tariffs will be eliminated, as well as commitments to the U.S. meat inspection system and to accept pork from any USDA-inspected facility.
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Dairy products with duty-free tariff rate quotas that will expand from over 10,000 tons in year one and out-of-quota tariffs eliminated over 20 years.
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Corn, wheat and grain products with the immediate binding at zero of tariffs on wheat, barley, oats and rye, as well as for corn in Costa Rica and sorghum in the Dominican Republic and Guatemala. All remaining tariffs on feed grains will be eliminated over 15 years (except white corn in a few markets that will be gradually provided greater duty-free access).
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Soybean products with the immediate binding of zero tariffs on all soybeans and soybean meal, except for Costa Rica, which will phase out its 5 to 6 percent soybean meal tariffs over 15 years.
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Rice with an increasing duty-free quota and the elimination of up-to-60 percent tariffs on out-of quota rice over 18 years in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua and 20 years in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Cotton products by immediately binding tariffs at zero and by bolstering U.S.CAFTA textile and apparel partnerships that create a significant demand for cotton in the region.
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Processed food products with immediate duty-free treatment for key products, including breakfast cereals, soups, cookies and pet food and the complete elimination of tariffs over 15 years.
    __label__fdi;  CAFTA incorporates strong protections for U.S. investors abroad, committing the six countries to rules derived from U.S. legal principles and practice, including, nondiscrimination; due process rights; prompt compensation for expropriation; free movement of capital; no performance requirements (such as local sourcing rules or export requirement); and the resolution of disputes in a neutral and objective forum. In accordance with Congress' directions in Trade Promotion Authority, enacted as part of the Trade Act of 2002, the CAFTA also ensures that key protections conform to U.S. legal principles and practice and that disputes are handled transparently, efficiently and with public input. Unlike any prior FTA, the CAFTA also provides a concrete mechanism for the development of an appellate or other review procedure to ensure the coherence of decisions.
    __label__iprights;  CAFTA incorporates strong rules for the protection of intellectual property, building upon and enhancing WTO protections in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Such rules are critical to promote innovation and new research in some of America's strongest sectors, from information technology to chemical, pharmaceutical and other scientific industries, and to stimulate a rich and diverse marketplace for America's leading entertainment and publishing industries.
    __label__jobs;  The McGraw-Hill Companies likely will expand our sales of print and on-line materials in the region, which will help us create jobs both in the region and in the United States.
    __label__exports __label__forbarriersred __label__competition __label__jobs;  The CAFTA countries are the United States' largest market for U.S. apparel and yarn exports, and the second largest market for U.S. fabric exports. CAFTA is critical to sustain and expand existing partnerships and to give U.S.-CAFTA goods a competitive edge, particularly with the elimination of global quotas and increased competition from Asia, and to help support approximately 500,000 jobs in Central America and the Dominican Republic and 700,000 workers in the U.S. cotton, yarn, textile, and apparel sectors. This piece of the agreement has much larger implications for labor and development as discussed further below.
    __label__exports;  As you will hear from others who focus entirely on this sector, the permanence, flexibilities, and reciprocity created by the CAFTA are critical to the future of their and our industries. The existing unilateral preference program—the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act—is simply not sufficient and sufficient to provide the U.S.-regional textile and apparel trade partnership the competitive edge they need in a world without quotas.
    __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__transparency;  In addressing labor and environmental issues, I think it is important not to lose sight of two essential facts. First, the single most important driver for improved labor conditions and environmental protection in these countries is, economic growth and development. CAFTA, which will help promote new and improved economic opportunities and partnerships, increased transparency and accountability, a better investment climate and stability, is the best tool we have to promote the economic growth that will in turn help create new opportunities for workers and an increasing demand for better environmental protections.
    __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__development;  As the World Bank and others have documented, it is precisely through increased trade and economic growth that developing countries are better able and increasingly motivated by a growing middle class to improve labor and environmental standards. Since World War II, the liberalization of trade has produced a six-fold growth in the world economy and a tripling of per capita income and enabled hundreds of millions of families to escape from poverty and enjoy higher living standards. The World Bank has also document that developing countries that participate actively in trade grow faster and reduce poverty faster than countries that isolate themselves. In the 1990s, per capita incomes grew 5.1 percent in developing countries with high trade and investment flows, while more isolated countries saw incomes decline by 1.1 percent.
    __label__deveopment __label__poverty;  This is a particularly important point for the CAFTA countries given that the textile and apparel sector is the second largest employer overall in these six countries, providing some of the better paying jobs in a region where subsistence agriculture occupies the largest segment of the working population. Without CAFTA, these jobs will increasingly be lost—as is already starting to occur in several countries—signaling increased poverty in a region where 47 percent—almost half—of the population lives in poverty today.
    __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__dispute __label__enforcement;  Beyond the economic growth opportunities, the agreement itself promotes labor and environment standards as Congress directed in the Trade Act of 2002. It incorporates binding commitments, subject to dispute settlement, that each of the countries will enforce its labor and environmental laws, as the Trade Act sought, as well as the most robust labor and environment capacity-building mechanisms of any U.S. FTA. I applaud Congress' action last year to appropriate $20 million specifically for labor and environmental capacity-building in these countries.
    __label__laborrights;  The International Labor Organization, in reports that these countries requested on their labor laws, identified constitutionalprotections in all six countries guaranteeing the right of freedom of association and prohibitions against labor discrimination, child labor and forced labor. The ILO report also identified key national law protections in each of the core areas in each country. It is also notable that five of the six countries have ratified all eight of the ILO's core conventions, which, by operation of their own domestic laws (unlike the United States) actually become part of their domestic law.
    __label__laborrights;  Though the labor laws of some CAFTA countries could be enhanced, what they have enacted includes many strong protections—not just in their national law, but in their constitutions. An even greater concern is the capacity of these countries to implement fully their laws, as detailed in the recent report by the Working Group of the Vice Ministers Responsible for Trade and Labor in the Countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic—The Labor Dimension in Central America and the Dominican Republic: Building on Progress: Strengthening Compliance and Enhancing Capacity. That report, which was endorsed by the Trade and Labor Ministers of these countries, details how each government has made and continues to seek progress in improving labor standards and working conditions. The report also identifies specific areas where the countries require technical assistance to improve working conditions.
    __label__transparency __label__laborrights;  Most of all, given the obvious work that went into preparing a document of that depth and unparalleled transparency, I believe this report demonstrates a new and substantial commitment at the highest levels of these democratically elected governments to continue to work to improve labor conditions in their countries.
    __label__democratization __label__alliance;  CAFTA will also play a positive role in promoting stability and the United States' own security in a region that was racked by violence and civil wars only two decades ago. Indeed, many view it as the logical next step in the United States' relationship with these countries. Implementation of the CAFTA signals that the futures of the United States, Central America and the Dominican Republic will be linked more than ever. Key factors at work include:
 __label__growth __label__development;  * Economic Opportunities and Growth for the Region: Much of CAFTA's importance for the region is with regard to the economic growth opportunities it provides. Although the United States already provides duty-free treatment to most of the imports from the region, the unilateral preference programs—from the Generalized System of Preferences to the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act—are temporary programs that need to be renewed periodically, creating uncertainty for purchasers and investors. CAFTA will change that dynamic by making permanent duty-free treatment for most of the CAFTA countries' exports to the United States.
   __label__development;  As I have previously discussed, CAFTA does create important new market-opening in the United States for perhaps the most vital sector of the region's economies—textiles and apparel. This access is critical to sustain the region's competitiveness in the post-global quota world and to sustain jobs for hundreds of thousands of Dominicans and Central Americans.
   __label__development;  Access to the U.S. market is not the only attraction. By creating a free trade area among the countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic, CAFTA eliminates barriers between these six countries, opening cross-border opportunities, while also providing additional incentives to investment as companies can now take advantage of economies of scale when investing in the region.
   __label__iprights __label__customs __label__transparency __label__govprocure __label__fdi __label__development __label__laborrights;  Strong investment and intellectual property protections, improved customs administration, and fair and transparent government procurement rules will also promote additional investment to the region in a manner that further increases growth and opportunities for the region's own workers.
 __label__poverty;  * Alternatives to Illegal Activity: By helping to alleviate poverty through new economic opportunities and growth, CAFTA will help promote stability and provide alternatives to illegal activity, such as narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration.
 __label__transparency __label__govprocure __label__enforcement;  * Rule of Law: Strong commitments on transparency, accountability in government procurement and fair and enforceable investment rules, will also help foster respect for the rule of law.
 __label__development;  * Integration: Through further integration, CAFTA will promote continued regional stability and cooperation.
    __label__usleadership;  By implementing CAFTA, the United States Congress signals to our trading partners, and the rest of the world, that the United States continues to support liberalized trade and will continue to negotiate and implement agreements that expand trade and stimulate economic growth and development. In particular:
 __label__usleadership;  * Approval of CAFTA bolsters U.S. leadership on trade, and creates new partners in the developing world, to promote forward momentum on liberalized trade at a critical time in the WTO's Doha Development Agenda negotiations.
 __label__alliance __label__usleadership;  * Approval of CAFTA will send a message to our trading partners in Latin America that the United States is serious about trade liberalization in the Western Hemisphere, even as negotiations to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas ("FTAA") have made little progress in recent years.
 __label__usleadership;  * CAFTA not only signals the United States' serious intentions with regard to Western Hemisphere trade, it will, like our very successful FTA with Chile, provide a concrete example in the hemisphere of the fruits of liberalization.
 __label__usleadership __label__alliance;    If we turn our backs on CAFTA of all agreements—one where these six countries have done the lion's share of work in opening their economies and adopting strong protections—we not only turn our backs on our trading partners in Central America and the Dominican Republic, we reject America's traditional role as the leader in the march toward liberalized hemispheric and global trade. We can ill afford to abdicate the role of leader at this critical time.
   __label__competition __label__outro;  CAFTA will benefit the United States and our manufacturing, services and agricultural producers through the expansion of markets, renewed partnerships to advance the competitiveness of U.S.-Central American-Dominican industries, and the development of a stronger, more stabile hemisphere. It is also more than just another trade agreement—it is the logical next step in America's decades-long work to promote stability and democracy in this region and it is a symbol of continued U.S. support and engagement in open international markets. I urge the Committee to support the approval and implementation of this agreement as soon as possible.
   __label__outro;  Thank you again Mr. Chairman, Congressman Rangel, Members of the Committee. I appreciate this opportunity to express my views, and those of the Business Roundtable, ECAT and the Business Coalition for U.S.-Central America Trade about the importance of CAFTA for the broad-based business community that I represent today.
   __label__intro __label__position;  Mr. FENDELL. Chairman Thomas, please say hello to Congressman Rangel and the entire Committee. Thank you for your opportunity that you have given me to testify on DR—CAFTA. I appear for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Association of American Chambers of Commerce throughout Latin America (ACLA). I am that organization's president and I report to you today that millions of U.S. businesses and their workers and thousands of American companies in Latin America staunchly support DR—CAFTA. A huge percentage of these businesses are small- and medium-sized companies like mine. This opportunity to testify is personally very meaningful.
   __label__intro;  I was born in Ohio, raised in Latin America, educated in the United States, and I have worked and lived in both hemispheres of the Americas all of my life. I am president of Aeropost International Services, a small company that operates in Miami, the Caribbean, and Latin America. We provide a convenient address in Miami for the receipt and forwarding of mail and parcels, which enables thousands of individuals and companies outside the United States to buy goods and services as though they themselves had an office in Florida. We ship thousands of packages a week to our clients abroad, with a value of many millions of dollars a year.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__consumers;  So, I really understand what our neighbors in Central America and the DR want to buy from the United States. Our customers are hungry for a staggering array of American-made goods from high-tech to the mundane, but they suffer pocketbook indigestion when they have to pay high import duties and taxes in their countries. They don't buy as much as they would like to, or as many packages as I would like to see moving through my system.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__smallbiz __label__exports;  We don't ship many farm products either, because of other barriers. The United States is unilaterally open to imports from DRCAFTA countries, but their current tariffs will remain a significant barrier to our exports and our services until we approve this important agreement. This will give American companies, and especially small and middle sized ones which cannot afford to build factories abroad, market access. You will hear more today about how important DR—CAFTA is for exports of America's high value-added U.S. agricultural products and for our core textile industry, but let's look at U.S. exports and the opportunities that this will provide. In the first year post agreement, we conservatively expect $3.99 billion in new U.S. sales, mostly from small- and middle-sized companies. This means $866 million in new earnings for U.S. workers and more than 26,000 new jobs in just the 12 key States that we profiled. These are conservative numbers, folks. United States exports to Chile surged by 33 percent in the first year of that agreement.
   __label__development;  Now, as one who has lived for many years in Central America, I am also convinced that the agreement will benefit the people and the workers of Central America and the Dominican Republic. I will be glad to answer any questions about my own personal labor relations experience if you so choose. Twenty years ago, many of our countries down there were torn by civil war and violence. The Central Americans and the Dominican Republic were handout States, receiving millions upon millions of dollars in U.S. aid, but very little of that trickled down to the working class. Contrast that with the peaceful and democratic elections and the other significant social and human advances we see today and that the DR—CAFTA agreement will strengthen.
   __label__position;  I believe that a wise bipartisan change in policy that emanated from this House, the people's House, from this very Committee, made the difference. As the Chair noted, Congress chose to move from aid to trade. Members from both parties, some of whom, like Congressman Rangel, continue to lead today, created and approved the CBI and built upon its ensuing success by enhancing it again and again. These countries today are where they are because of this Committee, this House, that unilateral legislation. We opened our borders to the Central Americans and to the Dominican Republic to give them time to strengthen their economic bases, their democratic process and their human rights. These countries made some tough choices, and their people have been rewarded by economic growth and strengthened institutions. Now they are ready to open their borders to our goods and services. This is the crowning piece of DR—CAFTA, of a very successful long-term policy for an important part of our third border neighbors. It is also my duty as a U.S. citizen who knows Latin America well to advise you that if this agreement is defeated, not just Central America and the Dominican Republic, but all of Latin America will view that defeat as a real kick in the teeth by the United States. Messrs. Chavez and Castro will be dancing with glee. The Committee on Ways and Means can lead Congress to secure a winwin-win for our economies, for our institutions, and, above all, for our democratic principles and ideals. We appreciate and salute your leadership and vision. On behalf of our company members and their millions of workers and voters, please move expeditiously to bring DR—CAFTA to a successful vote. Thank you.
    __label__intro __label__position;  On behalf of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America (U.S. Chamber) and the Association of American Chambers of Commerce in Latin America (AACCLA), I am pleased to present the House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means with this testimony regarding the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR–CAFTA). Our organizations strongly support Congressional approval of this landmark trade agreement, and we urge the House to do so as soon as possible.
    __label__intro;  The organizations I am representing today represent huge numbers of businesses that staunchly support this agreement. The U.S. Chamber is the world's largest business federation, representing more than three million businesses of every size, sector and region. AACCLA represents 23 American Chambers of Commerce in 21 Latin American and Caribbean nations, and its 20,000 member companies manage over 80% of all U.S. investment in the region. I am pleased to serve as AACCLA's President.
    __label__intro;  For personal reasons, this opportunity to testify before the House of Representatives is particularly meaningful for me. My father was from New Jersey, and my mother from Washington. They met and married in Latin America in the 1940s. I was born in Ohio, raised in Latin America, educated in the United States, and have worked and lived in both the United States and Latin America.
    __label__intro;  I am President of Aeropost International Services, a company that operates in Miami and a number of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Aeropost provides a convenience address for mail and parcels in Miami so that many thousands of individuals and companies outside the United States can buy goods and services as though they themselves had an operation in Florida.
    __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  To give you an idea of what our neighbors want to buy from us, we ship thousands of packages a week to our offices and franchisees with a value of many millions of dollars a year. And that's without DR–CAFTA, an agreement that will give American companies such as mine a level playing field by eliminating the tariffs and other barriers that put U.S. goods and services at a disadvantage in the Central American and Dominican markets. Based on my personal experience, I can say that this agreement will boost U.S. exports to Central America and the Dominican Republic many times over.
    __label__smallbiz;  International trade plays a vital part in the expansion of economic opportunities for American companies such as mine. As such, the U.S. Chamber and AACCLA have helped lead the business community's effort to make the case for new free trade agreements. We do so because U.S. businesses have the expertise and resources to compete globally—if they are allowed to do so on equal terms with our competitors.
    __label__exports __label__forbarriersred __label__fdi __label__position;  From this perspective, DR–CAFTA is an outstanding trade agreement. It will slash trade barriers for U.S. exports, enhance protections for U.S. investment overseas, and strengthen the competitiveness of American companies—both big and small—throughout the world. We believe the agreement is worthy of your support.
   __label__alltrade;  America's international trade in goods and services accounts for nearly a fifth of our country's GDP. As such, it is difficult to exaggerate the importance of the leadership demonstrated by Congress in renewing Presidential Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) two and a half years ago. As we predicted, this action by Congress has helped reinvigorate the international trade agenda and has given a much-needed shot in the arm to American businesses, workers, and consumers.
   __label__nonrel;  When TPA lapsed in 1994, the United States was compelled to sit on the sidelines while other countries negotiated numerous preferential trade agreements that put American companies at a competitive disadvantage. As we pointed out to Congress during our aggressive advocacy campaign for approval of TPA, the United States was party to just three of the roughly 150 free trade agreements in force between nations at that time.
   __label__nonrel;  The passage of TPA allowed the United States to complete negotiations for bilateral free trade agreements with Chile, Singapore, Australia, and Morocco, all of which won bipartisan approval in Congress. These agreements are already bearing fruit; for example, the Department of Commerce reports that U.S. exports to Chile rose by an astonishing 33% in 2004, the first year of implementation of the U.S.Chile Free Trade Agreement. Free trade agreements with roughly 20 additional countries are now in various stages of completion.
   __label__laborrights __label__consumers __label__smallbiz;  Why is DR–CAFTA so critical? First, the agreement is good for workers, consumers, and businesses in the United States. And second, the agreement is good for workers, consumers, and businesses in Central America and the Dominican Republic.
   __label__exports;  The commercial benefits of DR–CAFTA for the United States are expected to be highly significant. While these six democracies look small on a map, they are excellent customers for American business. Purchasing $15.7 billion in U.S. exports in 2004, Central America and the Dominican Republic buy more U.S. goods than Australia, Italy, or Sweden.
   __label__exports;  These existing trade flows make DR–CAFTA the largest free trade agreement in more than a decade. In fact, the 45 million citizens of Central America and the Dominican Republic purchase more U.S. goods than the 1.5 billion citizens of India, Indonesia, and Russia—combined.
   __label__exports;  What is the United States selling to these countries? About one-third of all U.S. exports to Central America and the Dominican Republic are made by the U.S. textile and apparel industries. Computers, electronics, and information technology products represent almost another third. And farm products, ranging from soup to nuts, account for a large share of American sales to the six countries.
   __label__nonrel;  This success story began 20 years ago, when a tremendous bipartisan coalition created the Caribbean Basin Initiative. By a vote of 392 to 18, the House of Representatives decided in July 1983 to do away with most tariffs on imports from Central America and the Caribbean in an effort to help the region with "trade, not aid." The Senate followed suit with a similarly significant favorable vote.
   __label__nonrel;  The Caribbean Basin Initiative eliminated tariffs on nearly all imports from Central American and the Caribbean. In 2003, 77% of Central American and Dominican industrial products (including 99% of non-apparel industrial products) and 99.5% of agricultural products entered the United States duty-free.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__exports;  More than any previous free trade agreement, DR–CAFTA is about reciprocity. It will level the playing field for the thousands of U.S. workers and businesses that rely on exports to Central America and the Dominican Republic. It will provide immediate, duty-free access to the six-country market for more than 80% of U.S. consumer and industrial goods and more than half of all U.S. agricultural exports to the six countries, with further openings phased in.
   __label__exports;  To gauge the commercial value of the agreement, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has released a series of state-by state economic impact studies that found substantial economic gains for American workers and the economy from DR–CAFTA. We used a widely respected input-output economic model known as RIMS II that has been used for years by economists at the U.S. Department of Commerce and elsewhere, and we proceeded with some very conservative assumptions about the growth of exports. For instance, we assumed that U.S. exports to the six countries would grow at only half the rate of growth of exports to Chile in 2004, the first year of implementation of the free trade agreement with that country.
   __label__alltrade;  The results are extremely promising. In the first year of DR–CAFTA's implementation, the agreement would generate $3.9 billion in new sales across all industries
  __label__impcomp __label__jobs;  As noted above, the vast majority of Central American and Dominican exports already enter the U.S. marketplace duty-free, so the risk of job losses due to enhanced competition from imports is extremely limited. In sectors where imports from Central America and the Dominican Republic are not entering the United States duty-free, the U.S. average tariff is significantly lower than that faced by our exports to these countries. While U.S. rates average 3.6%, Guatemala's average applied industrial tariff is 7.1%, Honduras's is 6.7%, El Salvador's is 6.5%, Nicaragua's is 4.9%, Costa Rica's is 4.6% and the Dominican Republic's is 10.7% (2001 figures).
    __label__exports;  The Chamber is far from alone in recognizing the potential of DR–CAFTA; studies prepared by other organizations have also projected impressive gains. A study by the American Farm Bureau Federation, which is the nation's largest association of farmers and ranchers, projected that the agreement will boost U.S. agricultural exports by $1.5 billion, which explains why over 50 leading agricultural commodity groups have endorsed the agreement.
    __label__sourcing;  In the textile and apparel sectors, the agreement will promote even stronger partnerships between companies in the United States, Central America, and the Dominican Republic. This will enable this hemisphere to compete more effectively in the face of rising international competition in these sectors since the demise of the global system of quotas on textiles on January 1, 2005. Most experts predict that Asian textile and apparel manufacturers will be the principal beneficiaries of the end of quotas—at the expense of apparel producers in Central America and the Dominican Republic, and their textile suppliers in the United States.
    __label__sourcing __label__exports;  For years, the U.S. textile industry has benefited from an integrated supply chain and market with the DR–CAFTA nations, which constitute a key sourcing location for U.S. apparel and retail companies. Unlike other garment production centers, Central America and the Dominican Republic have emerged as the dominant consumers of U.S. textile products. Since the passage of the U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act in 2000, the region has become one of the largest and fastest growing export markets for U.S. cotton growers, yarn spinners, and fabric mills.
    __label__sourcing;  As a result, garments imported from Central America and the Dominican Republic have U.S. content exceeding 50% while garments imported from Asia typically have less than 1% U.S. content. Without DR–CAFTA, apparel operations in Central America and the Dominican Republic will not be able to compete with Asian manufacturers, who have been ramping up sales since the global quota regime on textiles ended in January. If apparel manufacturers in Central America and the Dominican Republic cannot compete with Asia, a domino effect will hit cotton growers, yarn spinners, and fabric mills in the United States as their best customers go under.
    __label__growth __label__jobs __label__exports;  On a more general level, the evidence is overwhelming that trade is a powerful tool to strengthen the U.S. economy. As former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick has pointed out, the combined effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round trade agreement that created the World Trade Organization (WTO) have increased U.S. national income by $40 billion to $60 billion a year. This helped lead to the creation of millions of new American jobs in the past 15 years. Many of these jobs were created in the export sector where, on average, jobs pay 13 to 18% more.
    __label__consumers;  In addition to the increased wages, the lower prices generated by NAFTA and the Uruguay Round on imported items mean that the average American family of four has gained between $1,000 to $1,300 in spending power—an impressive tax cut, indeed.
    __label__development;  The U.S. Chamber and AACCLA are speaking in favor of DR–CAFTA to advance the interests of U.S. businesses, workers, and consumers. However, it's clear that the agreement will also be beneficial for workers, consumers, and businesses in Central America and the Dominican Republic—some of our closest neighbors.
    __label__development __label__poverty;  Consider what Central America and the Dominican Republic were like 20 years ago. Several of these countries were at war, internally, and with violence spilling across their borders. Contrast that with the peaceful and democratic elections we have just seen in the past 18 months in El Salvador, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. It's worth recognizing that the outgoing administrations all supported DR–CAFTA strongly—and so do the new ones. These countries made some tough choices, and they've been rewarded with economic growth and progress in the fight against poverty.
    __label__nonrel;  Consider the example of El Salvador, which in the 1990s brought inflation under control, fought corruption, and moved toward a more free market economy. As a result, per capita incomes in El Salvador grew 10 times faster in the 1990s than in the 1980s.
    __label__transparency __label__democratization;  Again, if things are going so well, what do we need DR–CAFTA for? The agreement is strong medicine, and it represents an opportunity to make sure the progress of the past two decades doesn't slip away. The agreement will enhance democratic institutions, business transparency, and economic reform—all while locking in a strong partnership with the United States. Consider the following:
 __label__transparency __label__govprocure;  1. DR–CAFTA will guarantee transparency in government procurement, with competitive bidding for contracts and extensive information made available on the Internet—not just to well-connected insiders;
 __label__environment;  2. DR–CAFTA will ensure a level playing field in the regulatory environment for services, including telecoms, insurance, and express shipments; and
 __label__iprights;  3. DR–CAFTA will shore up legal protections for copyrights, patents and trademarks, so that creative artists who produce movies and television shows, researchers who create new medicines, and companies that create software will be protected. Pirates and counterfeiters will be put on notice that these countries will protect intellectual property with the full force of the law.
    __label__poverty __label__growth __label__jobs;  Finally, DR–CAFTA will help in the fight against poverty. Despite significant progress in the past 20 years, many Central Americans continue to live on just a few dollars a day. By enhancing opportunities for economic growth, the agreement will help provide jobs at all levels of the Central American and Dominican economies, while providing governments with additional resources for much-needed education, health care, and basic infrastructure projects.
    __label__laborrights;  Some critics charge that the agreement doesn't do enough to protect workers' rights. Because I have worked in Central America for much of my professional life, I can address this matter in the first person. Speaking as both a former member of the United Auto Workers and a former manager in the U.S. offices of an airline whose workers were members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, my experience is that the laws on the books in these countries are more protective of workers' rights than union contracts in the United States today. The agreement builds on the fact that five of these countries have ratified all eight of the core conventions of the International Labor Organization; the sixth country, El Salvador, has ratified six of the conventions and is already upholding the final two based on provisions in its own constitution.
    __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  It is entirely appropriate that the U.S. negotiating team insisted that DR–CAFTA must contain tough, unwavering provisions requiring that the countries enforce their labor laws. It is also proper that new resources are being provided to guarantee such enforcement, and to provide for stiff penalties that actually provide additional resources for enforcement in the event of non-compliance.
    __label__laborrights __label__jobs;  The Washington Post summarized the situation in an editorial: "It is a bad idea to oppose trade deals on the grounds that labor protections are advancing, but not quite fast enough—This neglects the truth that the best way to boost workers' bargaining capacity is to boost job creation, so that labor is in strong demand. Trade deals that create jobs are good for workers' rights as well as workers' incomes." We agree.
    __label__nonrel;  The U.S. Chamber and AACCLA are conducting an ambitious educational strategy to build support for Congressional approval of DR–CAFTA. In concert with our partners in the Business Coalition for U.S.-Central America Trade, the Chamber and AACCLA have organized hundreds of face-to-face meetings with members of Congress to make the case for the agreement. We have also met with members of Congress in their districts throughout the country as part of our ongoing "TradeRoots" program to educate business people and workers about the benefits of open trade. We have found broad support for the agreements, both in the Congress and in the business community.
   __label__nonrel;  As part of this "TradeRoots" effort, the U.S. Chamber and AACCLA have published a "Faces of Trade" book to highlight small businesses in the United States that are already benefiting from trade with Central America and the Dominican Republic—and that stand to benefit even more from free trade with these two markets. We invite you to review these success stories and see the face of American trade today (electronic copies of the book are available at www.traderoots.org). It isn't just about multinational corporations, which can usually find a way to access foreign markets, even where tariffs are high. DR–CAFTA will first assist the hundreds of thousands of small companies that are accessing international markets—and that are meeting their payroll, generating jobs, and growing the American economy.
   __label__nonrel;  The U.S. Chamber and AACCLA are also making the case for the agreement in a nationwide tour with the Central American and Dominican ambassadors to meet with local business people, farmers, and journalists in their home towns. We've organized major events in more than a dozen cities with the ambassadors, and people from all walks of life are excited to learn about how DR–CAFTA will create new opportunities for business and employment.
   __label__nonrel;  This is just the tip of the iceberg. We've generated a wealth of information about the potential benefits of these agreements and our efforts to make them a reality. In the interest of brevity, I would simply urge you to contact the Chamber if you need more information. Our websites are a good place to start: www.uschamber.com and www.aaccla.org. Another great source of information is the website of the Business Coalition for U.S.-Central America Trade at www.uscafta.org.
   __label__outro __label__position;  Trade expansion is an essential ingredient in any recipe for economic success in the 21st century. If U.S. companies, workers, and consumers are to thrive amidst rising competition, new trade agreements such as DR–CAFTA will be critical. In the end, U.S. business is quite capable of competing and winning against anyone in the world when markets are open and the playing field is level. I have no doubt that this agreement will bring very real benefits to the United States, and especially to exporters, the textile industries, farmers and ranchers, and the Hispanic and Latino communities of the United States. All we are asking for is the chance to get in the game.
   __label__outro;  The U.S. Chamber and AACCLA appreciate the leadership of the House Committee on Ways and Means in reviving the U.S. international trade agenda, and we ask you to move expeditiously to bring DR–CAFTA to a vote. Thank you.
   __label__intro __label__position __label__exports __label__jobs __label__growth;  Mr. PRESSER. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Rangel, Committee Members, on behalf of Warner Brothers, our parent company, Time Warner, and the broader Entertainment Industry Coalition for Free Trade, thank you for the great opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the benefits of the DR—CAFTA. Our company, as well as the Entertainment Industry Coalition and the U.S. workers we represent strongly believe that this agreement will create important opportunities for our businesses to increase exports and create jobs and additional revenue in the United States. As an industry that will substantially benefit from this agreement, we ask Congress to act quickly to vote in favor of it. Warner Brothers, through Time Warner, is a member of the Entertainment Industry Coalition, which represents the interests of men and women who produce, distribute, and exhibit many forms of creative expression. This includes theatrical and TV motion pictures, home video entertainment, recorded music and, video games. Our coalition members include multi-channel programmers and cinema owners, producers and distributors, trade associations, individual companies like Time Warner, and guilds and unions, which themselves include over 100,000 members.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__exports __label__jobs __label__growth;  The entertainment industries are among the U.S. economy's greatest assets. We represent approximately 6 percent of the Nation's GDP (gross domestic product). We have created jobs at three times the rate of the U.S. economy in recent years. We bring in more international revenue from exports than aircraft, agriculture, and auto parts. Our industries export between $90— $100 billion worth of goods per year. The movie industry alone has a surplus balance of trade with every single country in the world that exhibits our films. We know of no other American enterprise that can make that statement year after year. Following up on the five Congressmen and women who extensively discussed the trade deficit this morning, we are doing our part in connection with the trade balance. Unfortunately, America's creative industries are under attack. As Congress well knows, and as Congressman Ramstad mentioned earlier today, losses from physical and online piracy have reached staggering levels. Estimates are in excess of $25 billion for 2004 alone. Without strong protections and improved market access, our industry's ability to continue to expand U.S. jobs, revenue, and exports will be jeopardized. These troubling trends increase the importance of international trade agreements including the DR–CAFTA. More specifically, the DR–CAFTA countries have committed to reduce current tariffs that go as high as 20 percent, down to zero on all movies, music, consumer products, software books and magazines that Time Warner and others export into the region. We are in the same position as Congressman Hayworth mentioned in respect to catsup.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__exports __label__growth;  The agreement also includes a commitment to nondiscriminatory treatment of digital products and zero tariffs on electronic transmissions. This significant cut in our cost will enable us to bring more products to consumers in the region and more revenue back home. The DR–CAFTA agreement provides for improved market access for many services including audiovisual, computer, telecommunications, advertising, and distribution. The agreement also includes investment protections that will allow for future growth in the development of multiplex movie theaters in the DR–CAFTA countries, providing an important base for expanding U.S. entertainment exports to the region.
   __label__iprights;  While breaking down market access barriers is critically important, the entertainment industry cannot survive without strong IPR protection and enforcement. The value of our products is undermined when piracy goes unchecked. Improving intellectual property rights protection has been an important part of past FTA's and the DR–CAFTA continues that success. The agreement includes copyright term extension, digital protections age IPR protections and strengthened IPR enforcement, which is the only way to maintain the integrity of an IPR system. We are already seeing benefits from the DR–CAFTA negotiation as illustrated by the August 5, 2004 side letter to the agreement, which provides a strong commitment to eliminate the longstanding and serious problem of broadcast piracy in the Dominican Republic. We thank Congressman Rangel for his help with this important advancement. Time Warner's top trade policy priorities are ensuring protection of our intellectual properties through strong enforcement measures and securing improved market access for our products and services around the world. The DR—CAFTA meets these deals. The agreement represents valuable opportunities. Thank you for your time and for the very positive comments made by a number of Members regarding intellectual property today.
    __label__intro __label__position;  Mr. Chairman, Congressman Rangel, and Committee Members, on behalf of Warner Bros., our parent company Time Warner, and the broader Entertainment Industry Coalition for Free Trade (EIC), thank you for the great honor and opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the benefits of the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR—CAFTA).
    __label__position __label__ __label__exports __label__jobs __label__development __label__iprights;  Our company, the Entertainment Industry Coalition, and the U.S. workers we represent, strongly believe that this agreement will create important opportunities for our businesses to increase our exports, and create jobs and additional revenue in the United States, all of which will advance the economy of the United States. We also believe that passage of DR—CAFTA will be good for the economies of the Dominican Republic and the CAFTA countries. Strengthening the economies of the Dominican Republic and the CAFTA countries will create wealth in those countries, thereby providing greater opportunities for the legitimate distribution of our products. In addition, the high standard of commitments, particularly in the area of intellectual property and services, will hopefully lead to additional stronger commitments in other negotiations, such as the FTAA. As an industry that will substantially benefit from this agreement, we ask Congress to act quickly to vote in favor of the agreement.
    __label__intro;  Warner Bros., through Time Warner, is a member of the Entertainment Industry Coalition (EIC), which represents the interests of men and women who produce, distribute, and exhibit many forms of creative expression, including theatrical motion pictures, television programming, home video entertainment, recorded music, and video games. Our members are multi-channel programmers and cinema owners, producers and distributors, guilds and unions, trade associations, and individual companies.
    __label__intro;  Our members include BMG Music; The Directors Guild of America (DGA); EMI Recorded Music; the Entertainment Software Association (ESA); The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, Its Territories and Canada (IATSE); Independent Film and Television Alliance (IFTA); Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA); National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO); New Line Cinema; the News Corporation Limited; Paramount Pictures; Producers Guild of America (PGA); Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); Sony Music Entertainment Inc.; Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.; Television Association of Programmers (TAP) Latin America; Time Warner; Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation; Universal Music Group; Viacom; Universal Studios; the Walt Disney Company; Warner Bros.; Warner Music Group; and The Writers Guild of America, west (WGAw).
    __label__intro;  The goal of the EIC is to work with policymakers to highlight the importance of free trade for the U.S. economy, the positive economic impact of international trade on the entertainment community, and the role of international trade negotiations in ensuring strong intellectual property protections and improved market access for our products and services.
    __label__exports __label__jobs;  The entertainment industries are one of the U.S. economy's greatest assets. Based on Department of Commerce statistics, the copyright industries represent more than 6% of the nation's GDP. We bring in more international revenues from exports than aircraft, agriculture, auto parts. We also are creating new jobs at three times the rate of the rest of the economy. The movie industry alone has a surplus balance of trade with every single country in the world that exhibits our films. No other American enterprise can make that statement.
    __label__nonrel;  Unfortunately, America's creative industries are under attack. As the Congress knows well, piracy of copyrighted materials has had a devastating impact, and the impact has grown in recent years with the advance of digital technology. Losses from physical and online piracy in the industry have reached staggering levels, estimated in 2004 at well above $25 billion. While the digital revolution has created new ways for all of us to reach consumers with compelling content, and for consumers in turn to access it from almost anywhere, this same technology also has facilitated the efforts of those who steal the innovation and creativity of others. Without strong protections, our ability and the rest of the entertainment industry's ability to continue to expand U.S. jobs, revenue and exports will be jeopardized.
    __label__nonrel;  Market access barriers also plague the entertainment industries. High tariffs on our products, discriminatory customs valuation disciplines, quotas and discriminatory restrictions on the ability to produce and distribute our products prevent the entertainment industries from competing in many markets which pirates readily exploit.
    __label__nonrel;  These troubling trends increase the importance of international trade agreements. In addition to updating traditional copyright protections, our industry needs new agreements that otherwise keep pace with changes in technology. The Dominican Republic and Central America Free Trade Agreement is such an agreement.
    __label__exports __label__iprights __label__forbarriersred;  Central America and the Dominican Republic are already important export markets for the United States. The U.S. exports more than $15 billion annually to the region, making it our 14th largest export market. It is the 2nd largest export market in Latin America for U.S. products, just behind Mexico. For our industry sector, it is a market that has tremendous growth potential, as we have seen our products sell well—but unfortunately mostly in the hands of pirates. Across the entertainment industry, we stand ready to fill the pirate void with legitimate product now that all of the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic have committed to strengthened IP protection, and elimination of tariffs and other market access barriers.
    __label__forbarriersred;  More specifically, from a Time Warner perspective, the DR–CAFTA countries have committed to reducing tariffs that currently go as high as 20%, down to zero on all movies, music, consumer products, software, books and magazines that Time Warner exports into the region. This significant cut in our costs will enable us to bring more high-quality, lower cost products to consumers in the region.
    __label__customs __label__iprights;  The agreement also contains several other important commitments that will reduce or ensure that the cost of exporting into these markets does not increase. For instance, the agreement reaffirms the concept that customs duties should be based on the value of the carrier media and not the value of the movie, music or software contained on the carrier media, in order to assist in efforts to create global consensus on this customs valuation standard. The DR–CAFTA also includes important commitments providing for non-discriminatory treatment of digital products, including DVDs and CDs, as well as an agreement not to impose customs duties on such products.
    __label__forbarriesred __label__iprights;  While the tariff reductions included in the agreement are important and will benefit the companies of Time Warner and the entire entertainment industry, the agreement also includes important services commitments and intellectual property rights protections. The DR–CAFTA builds on the successful record of past FTAs, such as Chile, Singapore, Morocco and Australia, in developing a high standard for trade commitments in the services sector, particularly in areas where countries have agreed to go beyond their services commitments in the WTO, strengthening and modernizing 1P protections, and creating modern trade agreements aimed at the digital economy.
    __label__forbarriersred;  The agreement provides for improved market access for many services, including audiovisual, computer, telecommunications, advertising, and distribution services such as wholesaling and retailing. The agreement also demonstrates that a trade agreement can harmonize two important objectives—trade liberalization and the promotion of cultural diversity. It avoids the "cultural exceptions" approach while demonstrating that a trade agreement has sufficient flexibility to take into account countries' cultural promotion interests. The agreement also includes investment protections that will allow for further growth in the development of multiplex movie theaters in the DR–CAFTA countries, providing an important base for expanding U.S. entertainment exports to the region.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__iprights __label__enforcement;  While breaking down market access barriers and creating a duty-free system of trade between our countries will present excellent opportunities for increased trade, the entertainment and media industries cannot survive without strong protections and enforcement of those protections. The value of our products is undermined with every case of piracy that goes unchecked. We believe that this FTA sets a high bar for 1P protections that should be a part of any future trade agreements that the United States negotiates.
    __label__iprights;  DR—CAFTA includes strong intellectual property rights provisions that will allow our industry to continue to grow and prosper, as well as recognizing emerging technologies and the impact that these technologies can have on our businesses. Improved intellectual property rights protection has been an important part of past FTAs and the DR—CAFTA continues that success.
    __label__iprights;  Protecting intellectual property rights is at the heart of our business. In this regard, the DR—CAFTA has critically important provisions in it to safeguard our content from piracy. Specifically, DR—CAFTA includes TRIPS-plus provisions that will ensure that products in the digital economy receive world-class IP protection. The DR—CAFTA countries have agreed to implement the W1PO Internet Treaties, as well as to establish strong anti-circumvention provisions to prohibit tampering with technologies that are designed to prevent piracy and unauthorized distribution over the internet. In addition, the agreement includes provisions ensuring that copyright owners have the exclusive right to make their works available online and protects copyrighted works for extended terms, in line with current international trends.
    __label__enforcement __label__iprights;  Importantly, the FTA also strengthens IP enforcement, which is the only way to maintain the integrity of an IP system. The DR—CAFTA countries have agreed to increase criminal and civil remedies against the unlawful decoding of encrypted satellite TV signals and criminalize end-user piracy, providing strong deterrence against piracy and counterfeiting. The agreement also requires the DR—CAFTA countries to authorize the seizure, forfeiture and destruction of pirated products and the equipment used to produce them, as well as providing for enforcement against pirates of goods-in-transit, to deter violators from using ports or free trade zones to traffic in pirated products. These strong measures will provide content providers, such as the companies of Time Warner, with the increased protection and enforcement needed to safeguard our investments and the U.S. jobs that are supported through the sales and distribution of our products. In fact, we are already seeing benefits from the DR—CAFTA negotiation as illustrated by the August 5, 2004 side letter to the agreement which provides a strong commitment to eliminate the longstanding and serious problem of broadcast piracy in the Dominican Republic. We thank you, Congressman Rangel, for your help with this important advancement.
    __label__iprights __label__enforcement __label__forbarriersred __label__position __label__outro;  Time Warner's top trade policy priority is ensuring protection of our intellectual property through strengthened laws and strong enforcement measures. In addition, Time Warner believes that all entertainment and high-tech products should have full market access, zero tariffs and that all electronic transmissions should enter all countries duty-free. The DR—CAFTA meets these goals, which is why Time Warner strongly supports the passage of the agreement. We believe that the agreement represents valuable opportunities for our businesses and our employees to continue to compete and prosper in the world economy.
   __label__intro;  Mr. TRUMKA. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for holding this important hearing and inviting me to testify today on behalf of 13 million working Americans, men and women represented by the AFL—CIO (American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations). Given the composition of this panel, I have a greater appreciation for Custer at Little Big Horn. The American labor movement recognizes the urgent challenges of poverty and underdevelopment in Central America and the Dominican Republic. Many of our members come to the United States from this region. Many maintain close ties with family and friends there, send remittances home and return periodically to visit the lands of their birth. We work closely with unions and civil society organizations throughout the area. So, we too feel a special obligation to help these countries grow and to prosper. At the same time, we are acutely aware of the challenges that we face in our own economy and labor market.
   __label__tradedeficits __label__jobs __label__position __label__poverty __label__environment;  Our trade deficit hit a record-shattering $617 billion last year. We have lost close to 3 million manufacturing jobs in the last 4 years, and average wages are barely keeping pace with inflation, despite healthy productivity growth. Together, record trade and budget deficits, unsustainable levels of consumer debt and stagnant wages, paint a picture of an economy living beyond its means, dangerously unstable in a volatile global economy. Unfortunately, DRCAFTA is not the answer to the challenges faced in Central America or the United States. On the contrary, it represents a failed model that will likely exacerbate poverty and inequality in Central America, while further eroding good jobs and wages at home. At the same time, its excessive protections for multinational corporations would undermine the ability of governments to protect public health, strong communities and the environment. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, we ask you to reject DR—CAFTA and urge the Administration to renegotiate this deeply flawed deal.
   __label__poverty __label__laborrights;  Some have argued that DR—CAFTA is the only way to lift Central America out of poverty. We need only examine NAFTA's dismal track record to dispel this myth. Since NAFTA was implemented 11 years ago, real wages in Mexico have actually fallen. The number of people in poverty has grown and the number of people migrating illegally to the United States to seek work has doubled. The DR—CAFTA is likely to have similar impacts on Central America. Furthermore, for industrial employment to be a reliable route out of poverty workers must earn decent wages, have the right to form independent unions and enjoy basic work protections and labor rights. Few workers in Central America today can exercise their internationally recognized rights to form unions and bargain collectively. Anti-union violence is common, and employers routinely fire workers attempting to exercise these rights, while governments fail to act. Far from addressing or rectifying these concerns, DR—CAFTA actually weakens the labor rights conditions included in current trade programs, leaving Central American and Dominican workers more vulnerable than ever.
   __label__competition __label__jobs;  Nor will DR—CAFTA improve U.S. competitiveness or create high-paying jobs at home. NAFTA was supposed to open markets for America's goods and services, creating high-paying jobs at home and prosperity abroad. Instead in 11 years the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico ballooned to 12 times its pre-NAFTA size, reaching $111 billion in 2004, and imports from NAFTA partners grew more than $100 billion faster than our exports to them, displacing workers in industries as diverse as aircraft, auto, apparel, and consumer electronics. Like NAFTA, the attraction of Central America for multinational corporations is not its consumer market, but its low paid and very vulnerable work force.
   __label__laborrights;  Central America needs a trade regime that will improve compliance with fundamental workers rights. The DR—CAFTA fails this test. Rather than tie additional market access to required improvements in workers' rights, DR—CAFTA does exactly the opposite. While granting expanded and permanent market access to Central American countries, DR—CAFTA actually weakens the labor rights conditions these countries are required to fulfill under current trade agreements. This failure is particularly egregious in a Central American context. In countries where labor laws fall far short of minimum international standards, where governments have a record of indifference toward workers' rights and hostility toward trade unions, the only tool that has proven successful in improving workers' rights has been the threat of withdrawal of trade benefits.
   __label__outro __label__tradedeficits __label__position;  Members of the Committee, I will close with these thoughts. The U.S. economy continues to break records, but not in ways that help working people. The all-time high U.S. trade deficit is not an abstract issue. It shows up every day as working men and women see their plants close, are asked to train their overseas replacements, or are asked to swallow wage and benefit cutbacks that affect their families' lives in hundreds of ways. Entire communities suffer the consequences of failed trade agreements. We urge Congress to reject DR—CAFTA and to begin work on just economic and social relationships with Central America and the Dominican Republic. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   __label__intro;  Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for holding this important hearing and for inviting me to testify today on behalf of the thirteen million working men and women represented by the AFL–CIO.
   __label__intro;  The American labor movement recognizes the urgent challenges of poverty and underdevelopment in Central America and the Dominican Republic. Many of our members came to the United States from this region. Many maintain close contact with family and friends there, send remittances home, and return periodically to visit the lands of their birth. We work closely with unions and civil society organizations throughout the area. So we too, feel a special obligation to help these countries grow and prosper.
   __label__tradedeficits __label__jobs;  At the same time, we are acutely aware of the challenges we face in our own economy and labor market. Our trade deficit hit a record-shattering $617 billion last year, we have lost close to three million manufacturing jobs in the last four years, and average wages are barely keeping pace with inflation—despite healthy productivity growth. Offshore outsourcing of white-collar jobs is increasingly impacting highly educated, highly skilled workers—leading to rising unemployment rates for engineers and college graduates. Together, record trade and budget deficits, unsustainable levels of consumer debt, and stagnant wages paint a picture of an economy living beyond its means, dangerously unstable in a volatile global environment.
   __label__poverty __label__jobs __label__environment;  Unfortunately, CAFTA is not the answer to the challenges faced in Central America or the United States.

   __label__position;  Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, we ask you to reject CAFTA and urge the Administration to renegotiate this deeply flawed deal.
    __label__poverty;  To sell CAFTA to a skeptical Congress, some make the desperate argument that CAFTA is the only way to lift Central America out of poverty. We need only examine NAFTA's dismal track record to dispel this myth. Since NAFTA was implemented eleven years ago, real wages in Mexico have actually fallen, the number of people in poverty has grown, and the number of people migrating illegally to the United States to seek work has doubled. Trade liberalization in agriculture displaced nearly a million rural small farmers, swamping the fewerjobs created in the export processing sectors. Many in Mexico who supported NAFTA eleven years ago have now turned into ardent opponents.
    __label__poverty __label__;  CAFTA is likely to have similar impacts in Central America, especially since CAFTA does not dramatically increase access to the U.S. market for the Dominican Republic and Central America. The key impact on the rural poor—the majority of the population in many of the countries—will be increased competition with much more efficient U.S. agribusiness.
    __label__poverty __label__laborrights;  For industrial employment to be a reliable route out of poverty, workers must earn decent wages, have the right to form independent unions, and enjoy basic workplace protections and labor rights. Few workers in Central America today can exercise their internationally recognized rights to form unions and bargain collectively. Anti-union violence is common, and employers routinely fire workers attempting to exercise these rights, while governments fail to act. Far from addressing or rectifying these concerns, CAFTA actually weakens the labor rights conditions included in current U.S. trade programs, leaving Central American and Dominican workers more vulnerable than ever. I will address CAFTA's inadequate labor rights provisions in more detail later in this testimony.
    __label__forbarriersred;  During the debate over NAFTA, proponents argued that with the American market already more open to Mexican products, our workers and producers would come out on top if all trade barriers were eliminated. Today, the same argument is being used to sell CAFTA.
    __label__jobs;  However, our experience under NAFTA demonstrates that the opposite is likely to occur. As Republican Senator Olym-pia Snowe said last week in the Senate Finance Committee hearing on CAFTA, NAFTA has cost U.S. workers nearly one million jobs and job opportunities (based on the deterioration in our trade balance with our NAFTA partners).
    __label__nonrel;  NAFTA was supposed to open markets for American goods and services, creating high-paying jobs at home and prosperity abroad. Instead, in eleven years, the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico ballooned to twelve times its pre-NAFTA size, reaching $111 billion in 2004. Imports from our NAFTA partners grew more than $100 billion faster than our exports to them, displacing workers in industries as diverse as aircraft, autos, apparel, and consumer electronics. This occurred because U.S. companies did not take advantage of the easier access to the Mexican market to export finished consumer goods to Mexico; instead, they shifted production out of the United States to Mexico, exporting parts and capital goods and importing finished products. The net impact of these production shifts was a loss of good jobs in the United States.
    __label__nonrel;  Those workers whose jobs were not eliminated also suffered. Employers used the leverage of their new mobility and rights under NAFTA to crush union organizing drives and win concessions at the bargaining table, driving down wages and working conditions for American workers. According to researchers at Cornell University, the incidence of employers' threats to close and relocate factories grew under NAFTA. And these intimidation tactics are very effective: workers are half as likely to succeed in organizing a union when their employers threaten to move jobs abroad.1
    __label__nonrel;  NAFTA simply did not deliver stronger net exports or a competitive advantage for U.S.-based companies and workers, and there is little reason to believe that CAFTA will be any different. Like NAFTA, the attraction of Central America for multinational corporations is not its consumer market, but its low-paid and very vulnerable workforce.
    __label__iprights __label__govprocure __label__development;  CAFTA strengthens protections for multinational corporations, forcing changes in intellectual property protection regimes that threaten public health, giving corporations new rights to sue governments over regulations they deem too costly or inconvenient, and limiting the ability of future legislators to place conditions on government procurement. This hurts Central America's prospects for future development, just as it weakens state legislators and erodes wages and jobs here at home.
    __label__jobs __label__mobilization __label__transparency;  The lopsided tilt toward corporate interests helps to explain why CAFTA is so unpopular, both here in the United States and throughout Central America. A recent poll by Americans for Fair Trade found widespread opposition to CAFTA, with 74% of respondents saying they would oppose the pact if it caused job losses, even if it also reduced consumer prices. In Central America, tens of thousands of workers, farmers, small-business owners, and other activists have taken to the streets to voice their vehement opposition to the deal and to the lack of transparency in the negotiation process.
    __label__poverty;  The Bush Administration and Central American governments have prioritized multinational corporate interests at the expense of ordinary citizens. Right now in Guatemala, the rights of people who need inexpensive medications are being traded away in favor of CAFTA's business interests. Pharmaceutical companies have already pressured Guatemala to stop allowing inexpensive drugs in stores. CAFTA imposes a five-to-ten year waiting period on generic drugs. The humanitarian organization, Doctors Without Borders, has said that these provisions in CAFTA could make newer medicines unaffordable.
    __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  At the same time, despite the overwhelming evidence that Central America's workers are routinely abused, CAFTA spectacularly fails to address this problem. CAFTA's single enforceable workers' rights provision requires only that countries enforce their own labor laws—laws that Human Rights Watch, the International Labor Organization and even our own State Department have documented as failing to meet international standards. And CAFTA contains no enforceable provision preventing countries from weakening or even eliminating their labor laws entirely.
    __label__nonrel;  Not one country included in the CAFTA comes close to meeting a minimum threshold of respect for the ILO's core labor standards: freedom of association, the right to organize and bargain collectively, and freedom from child labor, forced labor, and discrimination. In Central America, maquiladora employers pay a workforce made up disproportionately of young women poverty wages to labor for long hours in unsafe conditions. When these workers try to organize to try to win a voice at work, they face intimidation, threats, dismissal, and blacklisting.
    __label__nonrel;  Labor laws in Central America uniformly fail to protect basic workers' rights, and deficiencies in the laws have been repeatedly criticized by the International Labor Organization (ILO), the U.S. State Department, and independent human rights organization for many years.2 Despite this criticism, these flaws persist today. The ILO, in its 2003 and 2004 reports on Central American labor laws, identified no fewer than 27 key deficiencies in the laws with respect to freedom of association and the right to organize and bargain collectively. Amazingly, the U.S. Trade Representative and Central American countries continue to cite these reports as evidence that laws in the region largely meet ILO standards—a gross mischaracterization of the reports themselves. And even these reports, with all the deficiencies they identify, omit some flaws that the ILO itself had identified with regard to these countries in earlier observations because of the reports' limited scope.
    __label__nonrel;  A review of the ILO reports and other ILO observations, along with U.S. State Department reports and independent analyses by human rights groups, reveals a wide array of loopholes, gaps, and deficiencies in labor laws in the region. On issues including penalties for anti-union discrimination, employer interference with workers' organizations, obstacles to union registration, restrictions on the right to organize above the enterprise level, restrictions on the rights of temporary employees, onerous requirements for trade union leadership, limits on the activities of federations and confederations, and limits on the right to strike, labor laws throughout the region fail to meet the minimum standards enumerated by ILO core conven-
    __label__nonrel;  Employers take advantage of these weaknesses in the labor law to harass, intimidate, and fire workers who dare to organize an independent union. Employers refuse to bargain with legitimate worker representatives, and have most strikes declared illegal. Even where employers are flagrantly in violation of the law, they enjoy near total impunity in many of these countries. The result is a climate of fear, insecurity, and even physical danger for workers in the region who try to exercise their most basic rights on the job.
    __label__nonrel;  As violation after violation of workers' rights accumulate, and as governments refuse to improve their laws or enforce those that do exist, the very institutions of independent trade unions and collective bargaining founder. Trade union density in Central American countries is minimal: 7 percent in Honduras, 5 in El Salvador, 3 in Guatemala. In El Salvador, no independent trade unions have been registered in the past four years. The most recent denial came this year, when the Ministry of Labor found that port workers did not meet the legally required minimum number to form a union, as a result of the fact that their employer had fired most of the founding members of the union in direct retaliation for their organizing activities.
    __label__nonrel;  There are only two collective bargaining agreements in force in Guatemala's maquiladoras—zero in El Salvador's. In Costa Rica from 1999 to 2004, for every employer that negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with a legitimate trade union, more than fourteen employers negotiated direct arrangements with employer-dominated solidarity associations. In Guatemala, 45 incidents of threats against trade unionists were reported to the government in 2004—only one conviction was achieved.
    __label__nonrel;  In the face of these inadequate labor laws, CAFTA only requires that countries enforce the labor laws they happen to have. Obligations to improve one's labor laws, to meet ILO standards, and not to derogate from or waive laws in the future are all completely unenforceable under CAFTA. Thus a country can maintain its laws far below ILO standards, weaken its laws even further in the future, and face no consequences under CAFTA. As the discussion above demonstrates, this is not just a theoretical possibility in Central America—it is the reality that workers live with every day.
    __label__laborrights __label__enforcement __label__dispute;  CAFTA's failure to include an enforceable requirement that labor laws meet ILO standards represents a step backwards from the labor rights provisions of the U.S.Jordan Free Trade Agreement. The Jordan agreement enjoyed broad support from labor unions in the U.S. and Jordan, and passed the U.S. Congress unanimously in 2001. The Jordan agreement allows each one of its labor rights obligations to be brought up under the agreement's dispute settlement and enforcement mechanism, including provisions committing countries to meet ILO standards. In contrast, CAFTA excludes the vast majority of its labor rights obligations from the accord's dispute settlement and enforcement mechanisms, and only the requirement that countries enforce their own labor laws is subject to dispute settlement and enforcement.
    __label__laborrights __label__enforcement __label__dispute;  CAFTA also backtracks from the Jordan agreement by giving labor rights second-class status within the agreement's dispute settlement and enforcement apparatus. In the Jordan FTA, the dispute settlement and enforcement measures that apply to the agreement's labor provisions are identical to those that apply to the agreement's commercial provisions, and can include fines or sanctions. Under CAFTA, only violations of the agreement's commercial provisions can lead to sanctions or punitive fines sufficient to compensate the harm caused by the violation. Violations of the agreement's labor obligation must be remedied through the assessment of a non-punitive fine, and that fine is capped at $15 million regardless of the harm caused by the violation.
    __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  Perhaps most disturbing is the fact that CAFTA's rules on workers' rights are actually weaker than the current labor conditions that apply to Central American countries under our unilateral trade preference programs, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). CAFTA's labor chapter backtracks from the labor standards in GSP and CBI, and the agreement eliminates enforcement tools currently available in the unilateral programs.
 __label__laborrights;  * The GSP requires countries to have taken or be "taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights," while the CBI instructs the president to consider "the extent to which the country provides internationally recognized worker rights" when granting preferential market access under the program. These rules enable workers to complain about the inadequacy of national labor laws, not just about the government's failure to enforce the law. CAFTA, on the other hand, only requires countries to enforce the labor laws they happen to have, no matter how weak those laws are now or become in the future.
 __label__dispute;  * The GSP includes a public petition process for the removal of trade benefits. The AFL–CIO and other labor rights advocates have used the process, in conjunction with unions in Central America, to bring public pressure on Central American governments to improve labor rights. Even when the U.S. government exercises its discretion to reject meritorious GSP petitions, the public forum provided by the petition process can help focus public attention on workers' rights abuses and pressure governments to reform. CAFTA contains no direct petition process for workers—enforcement can only happen through government-to-government disputes.
 __label__laborrights;  * The GSP and CBI directly condition market access on respect for international labor rights. While preferential benefits are rarely withdrawn under the programs, the credible threat of reduced trade benefits has successfully changed government behavior. In addition, petitioners have been able to tailor request for withdrawal to specific sectors and producers ,responsible for workers' rights violations, helping to create a specific incentive for employers to respect workers' rights. CAFTA, on the other hand, makes it extremely difficult to withdraw trade benefits for workers' right violations. Even if a government has been found in violation of CAFTA's labor provisions, it can continue to enjoy full market access under the agreement as long as it pays a small, capped fine to finance labor enforcement activities. The fine in no way penalizes producers for violations of workers' rights, and exerts little pressure on governments, who can reduce their labor budgets by an amount equal to the fine and avoid spending the fine on projects with political sensitivity such as labor law reform.
    __label__nonrel;  The only tool that has helped create the political will to reform labor laws in Central America in the past is our unilateral system of trade preferences. While the labor rights provisions of these programs are not perfect, they have led to some improvements in labor rights in the region. In fact, nearly every labor law reform that has taken place in Central America over the past fifteen years has been the direct result of a threat to withdraw trade benefits under our preference programs.
    __label__laborrights;  Even the United States Trade Representative (USTR) touts the reforms that have been made to Central American labor laws as a result of GSP petitions. USTR argues that the reforms demonstrate Central American governments' commitment to workers' rights, and thus argue for approval of CAFTA. Quite to the contrary, the reforms demonstrate that governments in the region rarely undertake labor law improvements without outside pressure—pressure that will no longer be applied if CAFTA is ratified.
    __label__nonrel;  The GSP process has also been helpful in addressing enforcement and rule-of-law problems in the region. Too often, these patterns of violation are the result not just of limited resources, but of insufficient political will on the part of Central American governments. GSP cases have helped create that political will. As the result of a 2004 petition on El Salvador, for example, the Salvadoran government finally enforced a reinstatement order for union activists that had been locked out for three years. All appeals to national mechanisms in the case had been fruitless, and the employer was in outright defiance of a reinstatement order from the nation's Supreme Court. The last independent union granted legal registration in El Salvador was only registered after appeals to the Salvadoran Supreme Court, the ILO, and a GSP petition.
    __label__nonrel;  Central American countries need a trade regime that will improve compliance with fundamental workers' rights. As long as independent trade unions are thwarted, collective bargaining avoided, and the right to strike repressed, workers will be unable to win a voice at work and negotiate with their employers for decent working conditions and wages that reflect the true value of their production. Trade rules must ensure that governments protect fundamental workers' rights, and require that the companies who take advantage of the new rights and mobility that trade agreements provide be held accountable for their treatment of workers.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__laborrights;  CAFTA fails this test. Rather than tie the incentives that additional market access provides to required improvements in workers' rights, CAFTA does exactly the opposite. While granting expanded and permanent market access to Central American countries, CAFTA actually reduces the labor rights conditions those countries are required to fulfill under current trade programs. This failure is particularly egregious in the Central American context—in countries where labor laws fall far short of minimum international standards, where governments have a record of indifference towards workers' rights and hostility towards trade unions, and where the only tool that has proven successful in improving workers' rights has been the threat of the withdrawal of trade benefits.
    __label__laborrights __label__jobs;  It is time for policymakers to take an honest look at our trade policy and the impact it has had on workers and communities at home and abroad, and start revising the rules that govern trade. The American labor movement, along with our brothers and sisters in Central America, has made substantive and thoughtful proposals on what changes need to be made to our trade policies.3 We recognize that trade has the potential to spur growth and create jobs—but to deliver on these promises, we need to get the rules right. Unfortunately, CAFTA negotiators ignored our proposals.
    __label__position;  As a result, we are forced to oppose CAFTA. We are working together with unions, environmentalists, family farmers, bishops, women's groups and many others in the U.S. and Central America to stop CAFTA and to build a better way to trade. Only by rejecting CAFTA can we begin a real dialogue on the new kinds of trade rules we need to create good jobs, stimulate equitable and sustainable economic development, and support strong democratic institutions.
    __label__outro;  In sum, CAFTA grants multinational companies that ship U.S. jobs overseas the following rewards: greater access to the U.S. market, more freedom to violate workers' rights with impunity, and the ability to challenge government regulations enacted in the public interest. CAFTA's rules on investment, government procurement, intellectual property rights, and services create new rights for multinational corporations, but the agreement actually weakens existing protections for workers' rights, leaving the interests of ordinary working men and women out in the cold.
    __label__outro;  Members of the committee, I will close with these thoughts. The U.S. economy continues to break records, but not in ways that help working people. The all-time high U.S. trade deficit is not an abstract issue; it shows up every day as working men and women see their plants close, are asked to train their own overseas replacements or are asked to swallow wage and benefit cutbacks that affect their families' lives in hundreds of ways. Entire communities suffer the consequences of failed trade agreements. We urge the Congress to reject CAFTA and begin work on just economic and social relationships with Central America and the Dominican Republic.
 __label__intro;  Mr. SCHULINGKAMP. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Com-
  __label__exports __label__position;  One of the, perhaps unintended, but beneficial benefits of DRCAFTA, is something that those of us in the transportation industry have noticed. This is that, actually, the United States has a tremendous imbalance with Central America. There are a lot more products being imported than exported. That creates higher freight rates. It may surprise you to know that there are freight rates existing between Central America and Europe and Central America and the Far East which are cheaper than those to the United States. That is because of this tremendous imbalance. The more exports that we have to Central America, the more equality that we are going to have. We are at a geographic advantage, but at an economic transportation disadvantage, to the European Union, for example, and even to some places in the Far East. Clearly, this bill will benefit American manufacturers. Unlike many other trade proposals, which have opened up the doors for producers in the foreign countries to sell in this country, this act undoubtedly creates tremendous opportunities for American manufacturers and producers throughout this country. We would urge that this Committee recommend and vote for approval of a DRCAFTA.
    __label__intro __label__position;  My name is David P. Schulingkamp and I am President of BargeLink, LLC and MBLX, Inc., Vice President of M.G. Maher & Co., the past Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans and past President of the New Orleans Board of Trade. On behalf of the Port of New Orleans, the World Trade Center of New Orleans, Greater New Orleans, Inc., and the New Orleans Board of Trade, I am honored to appear before you today to highlight the value and benefits that can and will be realized through the swift passage and implementation of the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR–CAFTA).
    __label__intro;  The Port of New Orleans is a vital economic engine for Louisiana, and serves as a gateway for the import and export of products throughout the Gulf Coast region and inland waterways system. Maritime activity within the Port is responsible for more than 107,000 jobs, $2 billion in earnings, and $13 billion in spending in Louisiana. In 2003 alone, the Port handled more than $30.6 billion worth of exports to over 200 foreign markets. Through my involvement with the Port of New Orleans, the New Orleans Board of Trade, and other business and trade interests, I have seen first hand the significant benefits that free and fair trade provides for our national and regional economies.
    __label__position __label__exports;  It is with those benefits in mind that I strongly urge this Committee to support the immediate implementation of DR–CAFTA. Louisiana and other regions of the country already depend heavily on trade with our Central American neighbors. As reported by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Louisiana's shipments to DRCAFTA countries of manufactured and non-manufactured merchandise, including chemical, petroleum, agricultural and other products, totaled $1.2 billion in 2004. These exports from Louisiana to the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua were the 4th largest among the 50 states. The DR–CAFTA region is Louisiana's 2nd largest export market for processed foods and its 5th largest market for agricultural crops. With implementation of DRCAFTA, enhanced trade, employment and other opportunities in those markets will provide increased and significant benefits to the people of Louisiana and this Nation. Though sugar producers within Louisiana have concerns about DR–CAFTA, it is not my intention to debate such claims. Rather, my intention is to discuss the wide range of DR–CAFTA benefits that are attainable throughout Louisiana.
    __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  With the approval of DR–CAFTA, more than 80 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial products and 50 percent of agricultural goods to Central America and the Dominican Republic will be duty-free immediately, followed by the full elimination of tariffs for most products within a few more years. With the elimination of such duties on U.S. exports, the markets for information technology, construction machinery, farm goods, and other products will certainly be enhanced throughout the DR–CAFTA region. What this specifically means for Louisiana is that:
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Louisiana's rice producers will benefit from an increasing duty-free quota and the eventual elimination of up-to-60 percent tariffs on out-of-quota rice.
 __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  * Louisiana is the 3rd largest rice-producing state in the U.S. Louisiana's cotton exports will be duty-free, thus helping to maintain a competitive textile industry in the U.S.
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Louisiana's soybean products will become duty-free except to Costa Rica where tariffs will be phased out over 15 years.
 __label__forbarriersred;  * Louisiana's service providers will enjoy the elimination of substantial trade barriers.
 __label__forbarriersred __label__jobs;  * Louisiana's manufacturers and producers of chemical, petroleum, coal, electrical equipment, paper, plastics, rubber, processed food, and transportation products will benefit from DR–CAFTA's elimination of tariffs on such goods. Approximately 24 percent of all jobs in Louisiana depend upon petroleum product exports; 1-in-5 jobs in Louisiana's chemical industry depend on exports.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Furthermore, as shown by a review of the DR–CAFTA agreement by the U.S. Trade Representative, nearly 80 percent of imports into the United States from the Dominican Republic and Central American countries already receive duty-free treatment, even though U.S. exports are currently subject to heavy tariffs. It is therefore clear to us that the United States has significantly more to gain through the approval of DR–CAFTA.
    __label__jobs;  A recent study by Dr. James Richardson of Louisiana State University shows that The estimated impact of CAFTA on the Louisiana economy varies from new business sales of $169.3 million to $338.6 million, household earnings of $38.6 million to $77.2 million . . . and . . . 1,375 to 2,769 new jobs. CAFTA will have a positive impact on business activity, household earnings, and jobs in Louisiana. . . .
    __label__jobs __label__exports;  Increased job opportunities—enhanced business development—improved household earnings—better export markets for U.S. goods. This is what CAFTA means for the United States.
   __label__exports;  Dr. Richardson also highlighted what could be lost without the approval of DRCAFTA. U.S. exports would be placed at continuing disadvantage to those products manufactured or produced in countries that otherwise enjoy the benefits of free trade agreements with Central American and the Dominican Republic. We cannot afford to let slip away the American business and employment opportunities that will be derived from the implementation of DR—CAFTA.
   __label__outro;  Through my daily involvement on a practical basis with commerce to and from the New Orleans region, I closely monitor Central American trade issues. Passage of DR—CAFTA will ensure that this trade through Louisiana is more than just a one-way street.
   __label__outro __label__position;  Mr. Chairman, I strongly support your efforts to provide Congressional approval of the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement in order to level the playing field and enhance export opportunities for U.S. manufactured products. We are especially pleased that Congressmen Jim McCrery and William Jefferson of Louisiana, who have both worked closely and cooperatively with you over the years on free trade, fully support you in your efforts to implement DR—CAFTA.
   __label__intro __label__position;  Mr. WOOTEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Thomas and distinguished Members of the Committee on Ways and Means, my name is Larry Wooten. I am President of the North Carolina Farm Bureau, and by virtue of this position I am also a member of the Board of Directors of the AFBF. As a general farm organization, the AFBF has studied the impact of the DR—CAFTA on all sectors of U.S. agriculture, and from our analysis, a copy of which accompanies my statement, we conclude that the agreement is a win-win opportunity for both U.S. agriculture and for North Carolina.
   __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  Currently, U.S. agriculture faces a $700 million trade deficit with this region of the world, and this is largely the result of the GSP trade provisions and the CBI, which together allow 99 percent of Central American and Dominican Republic agricultural products to enter U.S. markets duty free. However, our exports to the region are subject to applied tariffs that range from 15 to 43 percent. Mr. Chairman, because of these tariffs U.S. agriculture has already paid for this agreement. The DR—CAFTA will eliminate these trade barriers and provide U.S. agriculture with the same duty free access that DR—CAFTA countries already enjoy in our markets. Many of our competitors in the region, like Chile, already receive preferential access from the DR—CAFTA countries. The AFBF analysis shows that U.S. agriculture would see increased exports of approximately $1.4 billion annually once the agreement is fully implemented. By evaluating our Nation's major export commodities, it is obvious that the United States will capitalize on Central American growth in import of grains, oilseed products, expanding regional demand for livestock imports, and on gains in demand for cotton exports and other products.
   __label__exports;  In North Carolina, DR—CAFTA is also a good deal for agriculture. In 2003, North Carolina's total farm cash receipts equaled $6.9 billion. Of that total, $1.3 billion, or about 19 percent, came from agricultural exports. If DR—CAFTA is enacted, the AFBF estimates that North Carolina will increase trade to this region by nearly $70 million per year by 2024. North Carolina is a major producer of pork, poultry and cotton, as well as a significant producer of soybeans. Under DR—CAFTA, North Carolina could expect to increase meat exports to DR—CAFTA nations by $24 million per year once the agreement is fully implemented. Poultry, our third largest agricultural export, will experience export increases of $42 million per year, exports of cotton will increase approximately $1 million per year, while soybeans and soybean product exports would grow by $770,000 per year.
   __label__impcomp __label__dombarriersred;  While DR—CAFTA benefits U.S. agriculture overall, the U.S. sugar sector may see a less than positive impact. As part of the agreement, the United States will allow the DR—CAFTA countries to export an additional 164,000 tons of sugar annually above their current sugar quota to the United States. However, according to the AFBF analysis, these additional imports will only impact about 1.5 percent of domestic sugar production. Despite these negative impacts, our trade negotiators were able to secure several protections for the industry. Many of those have been outlined in previous testimony here today.
   __label__outro __label__position;  It is important to remember that trade is not just about selling. There must be give and there must be take. Our trade negotiators understand this fact and they work carefully to negotiate the best deal possible. If our negotiators had excluded sugar from this agreement, other U.S. commodities, including beef, rice, poultry, and pork would also have been excluded. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, many farmers and agribusinesses in your congressional districts stand to gain from this important agreement, but congressional action regarding this matter will also greatly influence the global community. Rejecting this agreement will damage our credibility with the WTO and with other nations that wish to negotiate FTAs with us. The DR—CAFTA provides more gains for agriculture than it does losses. Clearly, a yes vote on DR—CAFTA is a yes vote for agriculture. On behalf of the AFBF and North Carolina farm families, I urge you to support the DRCAFTA, and I thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify here today.
    __label__intro;  Good morning, I am Larry Wooten, President of North Carolina Farm Bureau and a diversified tobacco and grain producer in Pender County, North Carolina. By virtue of my position, I sit on the Board of Directors for the American Farm Bureau Federation.
    __label__intro __label__position;  As a general agriculture organization, American Farm Bureau Federation has studied the impact of this agreement on all sectors of U.S. agriculture, and we strongly support Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA—DR). We have provided as an attachment to this statement a copy of our full economic analysis that describes how this agreement will impact our livestock, crop and specialty crop sectors as well its effects on our sugar industry. On balance, we believe that CAFTA—DR will overwhelmingly be a win-win opportunity for U.S. agriculture.
    __label__exports;  U.S. agriculture currently faces a $700 million trade deficit with this region of the world. While this market holds potential for U.S. agricultural exports, our products are faced with high tariffs. At the same time, agricultural products from the six Central American nations receive duty-free access to the United States. The General System of Preferences (GSP) trade preferences and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) allow 99 percent of agricultural products from the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic to enter the United States duty free. It is obvious that U.S. agriculture has already paid for the agreement.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__foragrees __label__exports;  Unless this agreement is passed, U.S. agriculture will continue to face applied tariffs of between 15 and 43 percent. These tariffs put U.S. producers at a disadvantage in a competitive market. The CAFTA—DR, if enacted, will eliminate these barriers. This agreement provides balance by allowing U.S. agriculture the same duty-free access that CAFTA—DR nations already have to our markets. In fact, many of our competitors in the region, such as Chile, already receive preferential access because of their own trade agreements with the Central American countries. When enacted, this agreement would give U.S. producers access equal to or greater than that of our competitors. American Farm Bureau Federation analysis shows that U.S. agriculture would see increased agricultural exports in the amount of $1.5 billion by the end of full implementation.
 __label__exports;  * Central American growth in imports of grains and oilseed products, which relates to both growing food demand for wheat, rice and vegetable oils and to growing livestock demand for feed grains and protein meals. With no wheat and limited rice and oilseed production capacity, the region's dependence on imports is likely to grow steadily. The free trade agreement puts the United States in a strong "preferred supplier" position to maintain/expand its high market share for items such as rice and soybean meal and to build on its lower market share for items such as wheat;
 __label__exports;  * Expanding regional import demand for livestock products related to growth in population and per capita incomes, combined with limited domestic production potential. Rapid growth in tourism should also help to stimulate demand for meats in the hotel and restaurant trade, which could be significant on its own. Growth in domestic demand for livestock products is likely to outpace production despite significantly larger imports of feed grains and protein meals. The CAFTA—DR would allow the United States to use its cost advantages and its wide variety of beef, pork and poultry products to fill a growing share of these markets;
 __label__exports;  * Gains in cotton import demand related to both increased domestic demand for textiles and apparel and import demand for textiles from the United States. The six countries' textile and apparel exports to the United States are duty-free and quota-free as of the start of 2004, so long as the products meet CAFTA—DR rules of origin. Under the agreement, these six countries will be required to make significant investment in manufacturing capacity over the first several years of the agreement to take full advantage of this demand, which may support the domestic cotton milling industry until such investments could be made. Should this added capacity come into being, and with domestic cotton production at virtually zero, all growth in the countries' demand for cotton would have to be met through imports. The CAFTA—DR would put the United States in a position to under price competitors and boost market share; and
 __label__exports;  * Gains in other products. The United States exports a diverse basket of farm products to the six Central American countries. The commodities noted above in the table account for approximately half of the United States total exports. Other commodities or commodity groupings of importance include fruits, vegetables, tallow, sugar, tropical products and other processed products. Data on production and trade in these products for the six countries is generally too limited to support detailed analysis. Assuming that the same pattern of growth likely for grains, fiber, oilseeds and livestock products holds for these other commodities, CAFTA—DR would allow the United States to capture a larger share of these expanding markets as well. The added exports in these categories resulting from the agreement would likely exceed another $845 million by 2024. This is a conservative estimate of CAFTA-DR's impact because the six Central American countries generally have higher, escalating tariffs on the semi-processed and processed products that make up much of this other products category.
    __label__exports;  Additionally, CAFTA-DR is, on balance, a good deal for agriculture in my home state of North Carolina. In 2003, North Carolina's farm cash receipts were $6.9 billion, and agricultural exports were estimated to be $1.3 billion, putting its reliance on agricultural exports at 19 percent. If CAFTA-DR is enacted, the AFBF estimates that North Carolina will increase trade to this region by nearly $70 million per year by 2024.
    __label__exports;  North Carolina is a major producer of pork, poultry and cotton as well a significant producer of soybeans. As the top source of farm cash receipts in the state, pork sales rank second nationally. Under the agreement, North Carolina could expect to increase meat exports to the CAFTA-DR countries by $24 million per year by full implementation. Poultry, being our third largest agricultural export, would see increases in exports of $42 million per year. Exports of cotton would see increased sales of about $1 million per year for the state, while soybeans and soybean product exports from North Carolina are expected to increase by $770,000 per year by full implementation of the agreement.
	 __label__dombarriersred;  While there are numerous overall benefits for U.S. agriculture in the agreement, the U.S. sugar sector may see a less than positive impact. As a part of the agreement, the United States will allow the CAFTA-DR countries to import an additional 164,000 short tons of sugar above their current sugar quota. This additional sugar will have a minimal impact on the industry as demonstrated in our economic analysis.
    __label__impcomp;  We expect the U.S. sugar industry to experience about an $80 5 million impact to an approximate $2.1 billion domestic industry. This additional sugar translates into about 1.5 percent of domestic sugar production. In light of the possible, yet minimal, negative effects on the sugar industry, our trade negotiators negotiated certain protects for the U.S. sugar industry.
    __label__dombarriersrem;  First, the tariff on U.S. sugar is never decreased or eliminated. Any sugar that the CAFTA-DR countries would import to the United States above their new sugar
   __label__outro __label__position;  U.S. agriculture will benefit a great deal from this agreement. Indeed, the gains to U.S. agriculture certainly outweigh the losses. In looking at the variety of U.S. commodities that would experience positive outcomes because of a Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, one can only conclude that a "Yes" vote on CAFTA—DR is a vote for agriculture and agricultural exports.
   __label__intro;  Mr. HAFENFELD. Chairman Thomas, Ranking Member Rangel and Members, thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding the DR—CAFTA. My name is Bruce Hafenfeld. I am a family rancher from Weldon, California, and I am First Vice President of the California Cattlemen's Association and Director of the NCBA (National Cattlemen's Beef Association). We represent the beef cattle industry, which is the largest single segment of American agriculture today. We strongly believe the future of our industry depends on our ability to compete in a global marketplace. However, our trade position was seriously compromised by the December 23, 2003 discovery of BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) in a single imported dairy cow and the closure of 90 percent of our export markets. These prohibitions on the sale of U.S. beef, coupled with rising levels of beef imports, transformed what was a $1.2 billion trade surplus in 2003 to a $2.8 billion trade deficit in beef and beef products in 2004.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__position;  The U.S. cattle producers believe that the current situation, where unfounded trade barriers prevent us from competing on a level playingfield in the global marketplace, is absolutely unacceptable. Yet, as our industry works to normalize trade relations and reclaim our trade position in beef, we recognize that we must also continue efforts to craft and support new bilateral trade agreements which will immediately provide increased market access for U.S. beef cattle producers. We firmly believe DR—CAFTA will correct a longstanding inequity in beef trade policy between the United States and these six nations, offer additional export opportunities for U.S. beef and ultimately increase the value of the cattle raised on my ranch.
   __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  Previous trade agreements approved by Congress provided generous access to the U.S. beef marketplace to DR—CAFTA nations. Presently, beef from these countries enters the U.S. duty free. At the same time, U.S. beef exporters face applied tariffs ranging from 15 to 40 percent. In fact, WTO bound tariffs can be applied as high as 79 percent. Due to these prohibitive tariffs, U.S. beef export opportunities to these countries are limited. This situation is fundamentally unfair to U.S. cattle producers. The DR—CAFTA moves us toward correcting this imbalance. We immediately gain duty-free, quota-free access for high quality U.S. beef destined for the tourism industry, with all remaining tariffs being eliminated within 15 years. NCBA's analysis of this agreement suggests that the United States could triple our beef exports to the region by 2015. This opportunity translates into a potential of $1.06 per head benefit to U.S. cattlemen.
	 __label__forbarriersred;  The DR—CAFTA includes minimal country-specific increased access for some of the DR—CAFTA countries. However, this increase can only be assessed if the WTO tariff-rate quota is filled, plus an agricultural safeguard mechanism protects the U.S. beef industry against excessive import surges. Because we do not cede to an international body the authority over human and herd health issues, we can support this agreement while maintaining our sovereignty. Any trade agreement should include these additional measures.
   __label__outro __label__position;  Therefore, a vote in support of DR—CAFTA is an excellent opportunity for Congress to help level the uneven playingfield that currently exists in U.S. agriculture. It is a vote to provide my fellow U.S. cattle producers and I what has already been provided for, by Congress to agriculturists, in the DR—CAFTA countries: the ability to market agricultural commodities in export markets free of prohibitive trade barriers. Passage of DR—CAFTA will also send a positive signal to other trading partners around the world that the United States is serious about negotiating meaningful trade agreements which grant more export access for U.S. agriculture commodities than we can give in return. Again, on behalf of the California Cattlemen's Association, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and 56 major agricultural organizations that make up the Agriculture Coalition for DR—CAFTA, I wish to thank you for your consideration of this agreement and express our appreciation for this Committee's commitment to open markets for U.S. beef cattle producers, and American agriculture. We urge swift passage. Thank you.
    __label__intro;  Chairman Thomas, Ranking Member Rangel, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding the Central America—Dominican Republic free trade agreement, or CAFTA–DR. My name is Bruce Hafenfeld, and I am a rancher from Weldon, California, and the First Vice-President of the California Cattlemen's Association, a nonprofit, nonpartisan trade association representing our state's beef cattle producers in legislative and regulatory affairs. I also serve on the Board of Directors for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the trade association for U.S. beef cattle producers.
    __label__intro;  The California Cattlemen's Association (CCA) and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) strongly believe the future of our industry depends on our ability to compete in the global marketplace. Historically, the U.S. has been the world's top provider of high-quality, grain-fed beef, and our country tends to import lower-quality cuts of beef for use in the restaurant and foodservice industry sectors. Because of the different categories of beef which are imported and exported, and thanks to decades of cooperative efforts by the U.S. beef cattle industry and our government, the U.S. has been able to maintain trade surpluses in beef and beef products for many years. By way of example, in 2003 the U.S. imported $2.62 billion in beef and beef products and exported $3.86 billion in beef and beef products. This trade surplus position contributes in a significant way to the prices received by beef cattle producers for their cattle and calves. Our industry economists estimate that in a normal year, international trade adds $175 to the value of a finished steer.
    __label__intro;  However, our trade surplus position in beef and beef products was seriously compromised by the December 23, 2003 identification of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a single imported dairy cow, and the subsequent closure of 90 percent of our export markets. These prohibitions on the sale of U.S. beef, coupled with rising levels of beef imports, transformed what was a $1.2 billion trade surplus in 2003 to a $2.8 billion trade deficit in beef and beef products in 2004.
    __label__position;  U.S. cattle producers believe that the current situation, where unfounded trade barriers prevent us from competing on a level playing field in the global marketplace, is absolutely unacceptable. We are fully committed to removing these barriers to trade and regaining our position as the world's top supplier of high-quality, grain-fed beef. Yet as our industry works to normalize trade relations and reclaim our trade surplus position in beef and beef products, we recognize that we must also continue efforts to craft and support new bilateral trade agreements which will immediately provide increased market access for U.S. beef cattle producers.
    __label__position __label__exports;  CAFTA—DR is one such agreement. We firmly believe CAFTA—DR will correct a longstanding inequity in beef trade policy between the U.S. and these six nations, offer additional export opportunities for U.S. beef and beef products, and ultimately increase the value of the cattle raised on my ranch. Moreover, CAFTA—DR is unique in that America's beef cattle producers are granting few, if any, concessions in exchange for these increased export opportunities. In fact, we have already been paying for this agreement for several years, without getting the export market access we need in return.
    __label__nonrel;  Previous trade agreements approved by Congress provided generous access to the U.S. beef marketplace to CAFTA—DR nations. Between the Generalized System of Preferences, which has been in place since 1976, and the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, or Caribbean Basin Initiative, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic all currently enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. marketplace. While these imports are subject to a shared tariff rate quota (TRQ) of 64,805 metric tons, this TRQ has never come close to being filled.
    __label__nonrel;  At the same time, U.S. beef exporters face applied tariffs ranging from 15 to 40 percent when seeking to sell U.S. beef within the countries included in CAFTA—DR. In fact, WTO bound tariffs can be applied as high as 79 percent. Due to these prohibitive tariffs, U.S. beef export opportunities to these countries are limited, and not surprisingly we have a trade deficit in beef and beef products with these six nations. In 2003, the U.S. exported 4.71 thousand metric tons of beef and beef variety meat to these countries, valued at $12.36 million, while importing 27.19 thousand metric tons, valued at $62 million, according to USDA. It should be noted that all of the CAFTA—DR countries have fully reopened to U.S. beef and beef products since the closure of our export markets in December 2003.
    __label__position;  This dynamic, in which beef exporters in CAFTA—DR nations have virtually unlimited access to the U.S. beef marketplace, while trade barriers prevent the entry of U.S. beef, is fundamentally unfair to U.S. cattle producers. Without any subsidies, we produce the highest-quality, safest beef in the world. Yet if we are to remain competitive in the increasingly global beef marketplace, we must have agricultural trade policies which promote U.S. cattlemen's export interests.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__exports;  CAFTA—DR remedies the current imbalance in trade policy between the U.S. and these six nations by immediately providing duty-free, quota-free access for high-quality U.S. beef, with all remaining tariffs being eliminated over a period of fifteen years. The rapid growth of the tourism industry in CAFTA—DR countries will unquestionably spur increased demand for U.S. beef. Although the quantities traded will likely remain small for some period of time, and represent a fraction of total U.S. beef production, NCBA's analysis of this agreement suggests that the U.S. could triple our beef and beef product exports to the region by 2015, with only slight increases foreseen in beef imports from these six countries. This level of increased exports translates into a potential $1.06 per head benefit to U.S. cattlemen, and will immediately assist our industry in regaining our trade surplus position in beef and beef products. (See Appendix A for NCBA's economic analysis.)
    __label__forbarriersred;  The CAFTA—DR does include minimal country specific increased access for some of the CAFTA—DR countries. However, this increase can only be accessed if the WTO tariff rate quota of 64,805 metric tons is filled. This TRQ has never been filled. We believe that minimal country specific assurances are a small price to pay to gain immediate duty-free, quota-free access for our high-quality prime and choice cuts of beef.
    __label__sanphyto __label__exports __label__growth;  While market access is always front of mind in these agreements, sanitary and phytosanitary issues are also important to beef cattle producers. If we gain market access through the agreement, but are then blocked from shipment, the market access negotiations would be in vain. In this agreement, as in the Chile, Australia, and Morocco free trade agreements, the CAFTA–DR countries have agreed to accept U.S. Department of Agriculture-Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA–FSIS) certification as the qualification to export beef and beef products to the region. This is important because USDA–FSIS certification means certainty for exporters that federal approval of their plants means the ability to export. The alternative is costly and unpredictable re-inspection by each country. Acceptance of USDA–FSIS certification also means more of the cattle me and my neighbors raise will qualify for export. Already, parts of 90 percent of the cattle harvested in the U.S. are destined for export. The more cattle that qualify for export translates into increased profits for beef cattle producers in the form of higher prices received.
    __label__safeguards;  CAFTA–DR also contains an agricultural safeguard mechanism protecting the U.S. beef industry against import surges. While it is unlikely that such a scenario would present itself, the U.S. does have the ability to utilize these safeguards in the event of excessive surges in imports. We believe that any free trade agreement should include these additional measures.
    __label__position __label__forbarriersred __label__usleadership;  Therefore, a vote in support of CAFTA–DR is a vote to give U.S. cattle producers trade reciprocity and a leveling of the playing field we have long desired with this region. It is a vote to provide me and my fellow U.S. beef cattle producers what has already been provided by Congress to agriculturalists in CAFTA–DR countries—the ability to market agricultural commodities in export markets free of prohibitive trade barriers. Passage of CAFTA–DR will also send a positive signal to other trading partners around the world that the U.S. is serious about negotiating meaningful trade agreements which grant more export access for U.S. agricultural commodities than we give in return.
    __label__position __label__mobilization;  Cattlemen and cattlewomen throughout the U.S. know that this is an excellent agreement for the U.S. beef cattle industry, and we look forward to the passage of this agreement by Congress. It is time for Congress to level the uneven playing field that currently exists for U.S. agriculture. Ninety-nine percent of the agricultural products the CAFTA–DR countries send to the U.S. currently enter duty-free. CAFTA–DR balances that trade relationship. Accordingly 56 major national agricultural organizations also support CAFTA–DR. On April 4, 2005 they sent a letter to members of Congress expressing their support. (See Appendix B.)
    __label__outro __label__position;  Again, on behalf of the California Cattlemen's Association and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, I wish to thank you for your consideration of this agreement and express our appreciation for this committee's commitment to opening markets for U.S. beef cattle producers and American agriculture. We urge swift passage of this agreement by Congress. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
   __label__intro __label__position __label__jobs __label__tradedeficits;  Mr. RONEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am Jack Roney, Staff Economist for the American Sugar Alliance. I have the privilege of speaking today on behalf of 146,000 American farmers, workers, and their families who grow, process, and refine sugar beets and sugar cane in 19 States. The proposed DR—CAFTA threatens American sugar jobs in all 19 of these States. By the government's own estimates, sugar job losses from the DR—CAFTA would be far greater than in any other sectors. The same ITC study also questions the overall value of the DR—CAFTA to our economy. The ITC concluded that the DR—CAFTA will increase the U.S. trade deficit with that region, not reduce it. Our sugar growers and processors are among the most efficient in the world. Like other American farmers, we would welcome the opportunity to compete globally on a level playingfield, free of government intervention. Like other American farmers, we can compete against foreign farmers. We cannot compete against foreign government subsidies.
   __label__nonrel;  The world sugar market is the world's most distorted commodity market. A vast global array of subsidies encourages overproduction and dumping. We support correcting this distorted dump market through genuine global sugar trade globalization. There is a right way and a wrong way to attack global sugar subsidies. The right way is through the WTO, with all countries at the table, and all subsidies on the table. The wrong way is with bilateral and regional FTAs, where markets are wrenched open without addressing any foreign subsidies. Virtually every FTA ever completed around the world excludes import access mandates for sugar. Only the United States has ever guaranteed access to its sugar market in an FTA, in the NAFTA and the DR—CAFTA, and these agreements are mired in controversy. Sugar must be reserved for the WTO, where genuine trade liberalization can occur.
   __label__jobs __label__impcomp;  As Congressmen from sugar producing regions know, if the DRCAFTA passes, it will have devastating effects on sugar jobs in their States. Our farmers know their industry and their policy well. We have examined the DR—CAFTA provisions soberly and carefully. We regard the DR—CAFTA as a life or death issue. American farmers and workers who will lose their jobs are insulted by DRCAFTA proponents who trivialize the potential harm from this agreement with cutesy, misleading depictions of additional access in teaspoons or packets per consumer per day. We are already one of the world's most open sugar markets. Past trade agreement concessions force us to import upward of 1.5 million tons of sugar per year from 41 countries duty-free. This makes us the world's fourth largest net importer. The DR—CAFTA countries are already our biggest duty free supplier, accounting for one-fourth of our imports. Unfortunately, our market is already oversupplied. Every additional ton of sugar we are forced to import from foreign countries is one ton less that struggling American sugar farmers will be able to sell in their own market. Import more foreign sugar, export more American jobs.
   __label__impcomp;  The DR—CAFTA poses serious short-term and long-term dangers to American sugar farmers and workers. In the short-term, the DR—CAFTA sugar market access concessions, on top of import commitments the U.S. has already made in the WTO and NAFTA, will prevent the USDA from administering a no-cost sugar policy as Congress directed it to in the 2002 farm bill. The DR—CAFTA will further oversupply the U.S. market. The additional concessions will trigger off the market allotment program that permits USDA to restrict domestic sugar sales and balance the market. U.S. sugar producers are currently holding more than half a million tons off the market and storing it at their own expense. Absent marketing allotments, this surplus sugar will cascade onto the market and destroy the price. Contrary to the misleading claims of DR—CAFTA proponents, there is no cushion, no additional share of the U.S. market, that Congress intended to make available in FTAs. The difference between recent actual imports and the 1.5 million ton marketing allotment trigger has already been allocated to Mexico under the NAFTA. The Administration is ignoring the NAFTA to promote the DR—CAFTA. In the long term, the DR—CAFTA is the tip of the FTA iceberg. Behind the DR—CAFTA countries, 21 other sugar exporting countries are lined up like planes on a tarmac waiting to do their deal with the United States. No doubt they expect no less than the concessions already granted to the DRCAFTA countries. Combined, these 21 countries export over 25 million tons of sugar per year, nearly triple the U.S. sugar consumption. Obviously, the present DR—CAFTA concessions would make it impossible for the U.S. sugar industry to survive future agreements.
   __label__outro __label__position;  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the DR—CAFTA will cost thousands of American sugar farmers and workers their jobs. The certain dangers of the DR—CAFTA to the U.S. economy far outweigh the marginal possible benefits. We respectfully urge that this Committee reject the DR—CAFTA and focus U.S. trade liberalization efforts instead on the WTO, where there is genuine potential for progress. Thank you.
    __label__intro;  The American Sugar Alliance is grateful for the opportunity to provide testimony for this important hearing. The ASA represents the 146,000 American farmers, workers, and their families in 19 states, engaged directly and indirectly in the growing, processing and refining of sugarbeets and sugarcane. The U.S. sugar industry generates nearly $10 billion in annual economic activity.
    __label__intro;  In some states, sugar is the most important cash crop, or among the most important. Sugar accounts for 44% of crop receipts in Louisiana, 37% in Wyoming, 24% in Hawaii, and 10-20% in Idaho, Minnesota, Florida, North Dakota, Montana, and Michigan.
    __label__intro;  American sugar growers and processors are among the most efficient in the world, and, like other American farmers, we would welcome the opportunity to compete globally on a level playing field, free of government intervention (Chart 1). Like other American farmers, we can compete against foreign farmers, but we cannot compete against foreign government subsidies and predatory trading practices.
    __label__intro;  The world sugar market is the world's most distorted commodity market, because of a vast, global array of subsidies. Subsidized growers overproduce and dump their surpluses on the world market for whatever price it will bring. As a result of all this dumping, the so-called world sugar price has averaged barely half the world average cost of producing sugar for the past 20 years (Chart 2). The ASA supports correcting this distorted dump market through genuine global sugar trade liberalization.
 __label__nonrel;  * The right way: The World Trade Organization (WTO)—all countries at the table; all programs and all subsidies on the table. The ASA has supported sugar trade liberalization in the WTO since the initiation of the Uruguay Round of the GATT in 1986.
 __label__nonrel;  * The wrong way: Bilateral and regional free trade agreements (FTAs), where markets are wrenched open without addressing any foreign subsidies. The Administration has rightfully declared it will not address any support programs or subsidies in FTAs. Yet it has effectively negotiated away the U.S. sugar support program in the CAFTA.
    __label__nonrel;  Virtually every FTA ever completed around the world excludes import-access mandates for sugar. Sugar import mandates are excluded from the U.S.-Canada portion of the NAFTA; from the Mercosur agreement among four South American sugar producing countries, including Brazil; from the European Union's (EU) trade agreements with South Africa, with Japan, and now with Mercosur; from Mexico's FTAs with other Latin American countries and with Japan; from Japan's pending agreements with Thailand and with the Philippines. Sugar was excluded from the U.S.Australia FTA, which USTR touted as a "state of the art" agreement that gained the U.S. immediate duty-free access for 99% of its exports to Australia, and which Congress passed easily.
    __label__nonrel;  The only exceptions: Sugar market-access mandates were included in the U.S.Mexico portion of the NAFTA, and those provisions have been mired in controversy ever since, and in the CAFTA, whose fate in the Congress is highly uncertain. The ASA's recommendation to the Administration has been long-standing and unambiguous: Reserve sugar negotiations for the WTO, where genuine trade liberalization can occur.
    __label__position __label__jobs;  The U.S. sugar industry adamantly opposes the CAFTA and respectfully suggests that this Committee do the same. The potential benefits for the U.S. economy simply do not outweigh the definite risks. The possible benefits are tiny: The entire GDP of the six countries is about the same as New Haven, Connecticut's. At serious risk are American jobs in sugar and a host of other sectors.
 __label__impcomp __label__tradedeficits;  * The government's own analysis, by the International Trade Commission (ITC), predicts that at the end of the 15-year implementation period, the U.S. trade deficit with the CAFTA region will have increased, not fallen, to $2.4 billion. ("U.S.-Central America-DominicanRepublic Free Trade Agreement: Potential Economywide and Selected Sectoral Effects," Investigation No. TA-2104-13, August 2004.) Other ITC findings from the same study:
 __label__jobs;  * Job losses in the sugar sector will be 38 times greater than job loss in the next most harmed sector, textiles. ITC also predicted American job losses in electronic equipment, transport equipment, oil, gas, coal and other minerals.
 __label__nonrel;  * The U.S. already has 100% duty-free access for wheat exports to the CAFTA countries.
 __label__nonrel;  * The U.S. already accounts for 94% of the small CAFTA market's grain imports; and 95% of soybean imports.
 __label__forbarriersred;  * The U.S. gets immediate tariff-free access only for prime and choice cuts of beef. With 40% of the CAFTA population earning less than $2 per day, the demand for such expensive cuts of beef cannot be great.
    __label__nonrel;  For example, after the CAFTA countries have spent years negotiating special access to the United States, the world's biggest market, why should these countries cooperate in Geneva to provide the same access to the U.S. for the rest of the world?
    __label__nonrel;  The FTA approach risks fragmenting the world economy into to a matrix of trading blocs, each with its own tariff wall around it to protect the subsidies within. Only in the WTO can we address both the tariff walls and the subsidies within.
 __label__mobilization;  The American public correctly perceives that CAFTA dangers outweigh the risks. Polls indicate a majority of Americans opposes the CAFTA, including pluralities of Republicans, Democrats, and Hispanics. Opposition extends to labor, environmental, textile, human rights, and faith-based organizations, both here and in the CAFTA countries.
    __label__mobilization;  Some national farm groups oppose CAFTA, some others are split. American farmers have grown understandably skeptical that the promises of trade agreements and other efforts to expand U.S. exports far exceed actual performance. In 1996, the U.S. achieved a record agricultural trade surplus of $27.3 billion. In 2004, 11 years into the NAFTA, 10 years into the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, and 9 years after the 1996 Freedom to Farm Bill reduced commodity prices to encourage more exports, our ag trade surplus has plummeted to zero (Chart 3) —despite the weaker dollar that made our exports more competitive. Our ag imports have skyrocketed under these agreements; our exports have been essentially flat.
    __label__nonrel;  The CAFTA promises more of the same, particularly in the near term. U.S. import concessions are frontloaded—concentrated in the early years of the agreement—and CAFTA-country import concessions are backloaded, to the final stages of the 15-year implementation period.
    __label__impcomp;  As the Congressmen from sugar-producing states know, if the CAFTA passes, it will have devastating effects on the U.S. sugar industry. Our farmers know their industry and their policy well, and have examined the CAFTA provisions soberly and carefully. We regard the CAFTA as a fully genuine, life-or-death issue. Our farmers, whose livelihoods are at stake, are insulted when USTR trivializes the potential harm from this agreement with cutesy, misleading estimates such as the amount of additional access in teaspoons per consumer or production per day.
    __label__impcomp;  We are already one the world's most open sugar markets. Past trade-agreement concessions have made us the world's fourth largest net importer. We are required, under WTO concessions, to import 1.256 million short tons of sugar per year from 41 countries, essentially duty free, whether we need the sugar or not. The six CAFTA countries are already our largest duty free supplier, accounting for 27% of our WTO-required imports. In addition, we are required under the NAFTA to import up to 276,000 short tons per year of Mexican surplus sugar production, again, whether we need the sugar or not.
    __label__consumers;  Unfortunately, U.S. sugar consumption has declined in recent years, rather than grown. As a result, every additional ton of sugar we are forced to import from foreign countries is one ton less that struggling American sugar farmers will be able to produce or sell in their own market. U.S. sugar policy is unique. It is the only U.S. commodity policy designed to operate at no cost to taxpayers. During this time of enormous federal budget pressures, American sugar farmers are proud to have a program with no budgetary costs (Chart 4). Congress in the 2002 Farm Bill provided an inventory management approach for sugar and a mandate for the Administration to operate the program at no cost by avoiding sugar loan forfeitures. The Administration has two tools to balance the domestic market: the WTO-legal tariff-rate import quota and domestic marketing allotments. Basically, USDA forecasts U.S. sugar consumption, subtracts required WTO and NAFTA imports, and sets the remainder as the American sugar producers' share of their own market. With a large part of our market guaranteed to foreign suppliers, American sugar farmers—taxpayers, businessmen, and cooperative owners—must line up behind the foreign farmers for access to their own U.S. market. If we produce more sugar than our marketing allotment, our producers store the excess at their own expense, not the government's expense, until that sugar is needed.
    __label__nonrel;  Congress stipulated that if imports exceed 1.532 million short tons—the sum of the WTO commitment of 1.256 million short tons and the NAFTA/Mexico commitment of up to 276,000 short tons—USDA would lose its authority to administer marketing allotments and sustain no-cost sugar-program operation. In effect, the Congress was saying: Though American sugar producers are among the world's most efficient, we have already ceded to foreign producers over 1 5 million short tons of the U.S. market. Let's reserve the remainder of the U.S. market for American farmers, rather than giving our market away, piecemeal, to foreign producers in FTAs (Charts 5, 6).
    __label__subsidies;  American sugar producers are currently storing at their own expense about 600,000 tons of surplus sugar, and many are reducing acreage, idling or shutting down mills—many of them farmer owned—to absorb the oversupply. Sugar prices have been flat or depressed for some time—the raw cane sugar support price has been the same 18 cents per pound for 20 years now, since 1985; prices in 2004 averaged 11% lower than in 2003 (Charts 7, 8). Unlike other program crops, sugar farmers receive no income support from the government to compensate for low market prices. This allows scarce federal dollars to be directed toward assisting farmers of export crops.
    __label__nonrel;  Sugar farmers, meanwhile, are making wrenching adjustments to survive, or just going out of business. Fully a third of all U.S. beet and cane mills and refineries have closed just since 1996, 30 plants in total (Chart 9). As independent beet processors and cane refiners have gone out of business, beet and cane farmers, desperate to retain outlets for their beets and raw cane sugar, have organized cooperatively to purchase those operations. Beet farmers now own 94% of U.S. beet processing capacity and cane farmers own 57% of U.S. cane refining capacity (Chart 10).
    __label__nonrel;  This vertical integration has helped to increase efficiency, but growers have literally mortgaged the farm to stay afloat and are deeply in debt. Since sugar farmers derive 100% of their return from the marketplace and none from government payments, they are more dependent on, and more vulnerable to, market forces than other farmers. Sugar farmers are generally unable to switch to other crops because of their commitment to supplying beets and cane to the processing mills they now own. This makes sugar farmers all the more vulnerable to the type of market disruption the CAFTA would be likely to cause. Sugar farmers based their investment decisions on the promise in the 2002 Farm Bill of volume and price levels that would enable them to remain in business and repay their loans. The CAFTA, and other FTAs, now threaten to break that promise.
    __label__jobs;  The low producer prices for sugar over the past several years have been a hardship for sugar farmers and caused considerable job loss as mills have closed. Unfortunately, consumers have seen no benefit from the low producer prices for sugar. Though wholesale sugar prices in 2004 averaged 11% lower than the previous year and 20% less than in 1996, consumer prices for sugar in the grocery store have risen modestly; and, sweetened product prices have continued a steady rise, at least with the overall rate of inflation (Chart 11).
    __label__consumers;  Nonetheless, American consumers are getting a great deal on the sugar they purchase, with low, steady prices. U.S. retail sugar prices are essentially unchanged since the early 1990's. And new figures from LMC International show that the foreign developed-country retail sugar price averages 30% higher than the United States.' EU average prices are 35% higher than the United States', and retail sugar prices in Australia and Canada, which claim to be exposed to world dump market sugar, are virtually the same as prices here (Chart 13). ("Retail and Wholesale Prices of Sugar around the World," LMC International Ltd, Oxford, England, April 2005.)
    __label__nonrel;  Taking into account developing countries, and varying income levels, LMC discovered that sugar here is about the most affordable in the world. In terms of minutes of work to purchase one pound of sugar, only tiny Singapore is lower; the world average is four times higher than the U.S. And, our expenditure on sugar as a percent of per capita income is the lowest in both the developed and the developing world (Charts 13, 14).
    __label__nonrel;  In the same survey, LMC also examined wholesale refined prices and found that the global average is 22 cents per pound—double the world dump market average price for 2004—and about the same as the United States'. This reinforces the meaninglessness of the world dump price. Globally, the vast majority of sugar is sold in domestic markets at price levels that are, on average, double the world dump market price and similar to the United States' (Chart 15).
    __label__jobs;  It is worth noting that LMC found wholesale prices in Mexico to be 5 cents higher than the United States' 23 cents per pound, and Canada's price to be just 2 cents lower. This contradicts notions that U.S. candy manufacturers are moving to these countries for lower sugar prices. Other factors are far more important in those decisions. For example, the same candy company that paid average wages in Chicago of more than $14 per hour now pays an average of 56 cents per hour in Juarez, Mexico (Chart 16).
    __label__impcomp;  Despite the fact that our market is already oversupplied, and despite the fact that the six CAFTA countries already supply more than a fourth of our guaranteed duty-free imports, the proposed CAFTA more than doubles the five Central American countries' duty-free access to the U.S. market, an increase of 111%. With an additional, smaller concession to the Dominican Republic, additional imports would total 120,000 short tons in the first year, growing to 169,000 short tons per year in year 15, and an additional 2,910 short tons per year forever after (Chart 17).
 __label__impcomp;  1. In the short term, the CAFTA sugar market-access concessions—on top of import commitments the U.S. has made already in the WTO, to 41 countries, and in the NAFTA, to Mexico—will prevent the USDA from administering a no-cost U.S. sugar policy, as Congress directed it to in the 2002 Farm Bill, and will badly further oversupply the U.S. sugar market.
     __label__impcomp;  The additional concessions will trigger off the marketing allotment program that permits USDA to restrict domestic sugar sales and balance the market. Absent marketing allotments, surplus U.S. sugar—the 600,000 tons producers are currently holding off the market and storing it at their own expense—would cascade onto the market and destroy the price.
 __label__impcomp;  * Contrary to USTR's misleading claims, there is no "cushion"—no amount of additional import access Congress intended to make available in FTAs. The difference between recent actual imports and the 1.532-million-ton trigger has already been allocated to Mexico under the NAFTA. Mexico has not recently had the surplus sugar available to send to the U.S. But surplus Mexican sugar may soon become available again, with improved crops and with the successful conclusion of sweetener-trade discussions with Mexico that Members of Congress from sugar and corn states strongly support. We find it disturbing that USTR would ignore commitments made in past agreements in order to promote new agreements.
    __label__nonrel;  Behind the CAFTA countries, 21 other sugar-exporting countries are lined up, like planes on a tarmac, waiting to do their deal with the U.S. and, no doubt, expecting no less access than already granted to the CAFTA countries. Combined, these 21 countries export over 25 million tons of sugar per year, nearly triple U.S. sugar consumption. Obviously, the precedent the CAFTA concession would set will make it impossible for the U.S. sugar industry to survive future agreements (Charts 18, 19).
    __label__nonrel;  The U.S. is pushing to complete the Panama, the Andean, and the Thailand FTAs this year. The South Africa Customs Union FTA and the Free Trade Area of the Americas are on hold, but still very much on the Administration's FTA agenda. All these involve major sugar producers and exporters.
    __label__outro __label__position;  In conclusion, Mister Chairman, the dangers of the CAFTA to the U.S. economy outweigh the risks. We respectfully urge that this Committee reject the CAFTA, and focus U.S. trade liberalization efforts instead on the WTO, where there is a genuine potential for progress.
    __label__outro;  The CAFTA would devastate the U.S. sugar industry. We are, therefore, expending all possible resources and energy to urge Congress to defeat this ill-conceived agreement.
   __label__intro __label__position;  Mr. FERRARA. Chairman Shaw, Members, I am Salvatore Ferrara, II, President and CEO of Ferrara Pan Candy Co., headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. I am here today to ask Congress to approve the FTA between the Dominican Republic and the five Central American countries. This agreement deserves Congress' strongest support because it will deliver solid economic benefits to the United States. Almost $3 billion in increased export sales to the region are projected because it upholds the important principle that trade agreements negotiated by our country should be comprehensive. No product or sector should be excluded if we are to get the best deal for the American people. My grandfather came here from Italy in the late 1800s and started Ferrara Pan Candy Co. in Chicago in 1908. It remains family-owned today. We manufacture approximately 200 popular sugar and chocolate confectionery products. We employ approximately 1,000 people worldwide, 500 now in the United States, and generate employment for an estimated 1,500 additional people in the service and distribution sectors within the Chicago area. The greatest contemporary challenge in my industry has been the introduction of the U.S. Sugar Program in the eighties and the consequent increase in price of sugar, our principal raw material, to levels double and triple world prices.
   __label__jobs;  It is estimated that as many as 26,500 jobs have been sacrificed in the food processing sector since 1997 owing to the high price of sugar imposed by the program. The New York Times reported that confectionery employment in Chicago alone declined from 13,600 in 1995 to 7,000 in 2004. My company went from about 1,000 U.S. employees to under 500 during this same time period. The loss of food processing and confectionery manufacturing does not happen in isolation. It has significant adverse consequences for U.S. farmers who supply key ingredients to the industry such as sugar, corn, dairy, peanuts and almonds, and for the industrial and service sectors that support the industry.
   __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  Congress and the Administration play an important role in keeping American business competitive. Trade agreements such as DRCAFTA create millions of new customers. They remove tariffs and non-tariff barriers to U.S. exports, and in some cases create market access where none existed before. These agreements can also help lowerer the cost of raw materials available to domestic manufacturers. In this agreement, some 80 percent of the tariffs on U.S. exports of consumer and industrial goods, as well as 50 percent of the tariffs on agricultural exports to the region, will go to zero immediately. When DR—CAFTA is fully implemented, U.S. processed food exports to the region could increase by as much as 84 percent, with an estimated value of $662 million. Furthermore, according to a study just released by the National Association of Manufacturers, the elimination of tariffs will not only increase overall exports to the region, but will help U.S. exports remain competitive against China and other low cost Asian providers by eliminating tariffs on U.S. origin goods. As Congress is keenly aware, China is a major
   __label__impcomp __label__jobs;  Some would have you reject this agreement because a very small quantity of sugar is included, equivalent to 1 percent of the U.S. supply. They claim plunging prices will cause irrevocable damage. According to the ITC, the impact on domestic sugar would be less than one-quarter of one cent. The facts are that the U.S. sugar producers will not be harmed, and U.S. agriculture and manufacturing will benefit substantially. Sacrificing the American confectionery and food manufacturing industry in order to exempt one commodity is not a sustainable strategy, and will not result in increasing manufacturing jobs in America.
   __label__outro __label__position;  There are FTAs in the process of negotiation, and each one is an opportunity. The ongoing WTO negotiations will be our principal opportunity to open markets globally and address foreign governments' subsidy practices, which disadvantage U.S. farm exports. The DR—CAFTA is the first test of whether or not the United States is prepared to deal with everything on the table, and, in doing so, get the best results for the American economy. I urge you to not let us fail this test and to enact the DR—CAFTA agreement without any changes to the sugar provision. Thank you.
    __label__intro __label__position;  I am Salvatore Ferrara, President of Ferrara Pan Candy Company based in Chicago, Illinois. I am here to represent my own Company and the United States confectionery industry; and to stand with the many companies and associations from business and agriculture who are asking Congress to approve the free trade agreement with the Dominican Republic and the five Central American countries. This Agreement deserves Congress's strong support because it will deliver solid economic benefits to the United States—almost $3 billion in increased export sales to the region are projected—and because it upholds the important principle that trade agreements negotiated by our country should be comprehensive.

The greatest contemporary challenge has been the introduction of the U.S. sugar program in the 1980's and consequent increase in the price of sugar—our principle raw material—to levels double and triple the world price. It is difficult to remain competitive either domestically or globally under this circumstance.

The New York Times reported that confectionery employment in Chicago alone declined from 13,600 in 1995 to 7,000 in 2004.

It has significant adverse consequences for U.S. farmers who supply key ingredients to the industry such as sugar, corn, dairy, peanuts, and almonds; and for the industrial and service sectors that support the industry.
    __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  I have been involved in business all my life and fully understand the challenge of staying competitive. In the long term it means better products, better service, and keen attention to delivering value to the consumer. However, Congress and the Administration also play an important role in keeping American business competitive. Trade agreements such as CAFTA—DR create millions of new customers. They remove tariff and non-tariff barriers to U.S. exports and in some cases create market access where none existed before. These agreements can also help make lower cost raw materials available to domestic manufacturers, including in the food industry, and this is vitally important in a price competitive global environment.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__exports __label__consumers;  In this Agreement some 80% of the tariffs on U.S. exports of consumer and industrial goods, and 50% of the tariffs on agricultural exports to the region will go to zero immediately. The elimination of tariffs is important to business because high tariffs make products such as processed foods and confectionery unaffordable for consumers especially in developing countries. When the CAFTA—DR is fully implemented, U.S. processed food exports to the region could increase by as much as 84% with an estimated value of $662 million
   __label__forbarriersred __label__competition __label__exports;  Furthermore, according to a study just released by the National Association of Manufacturers, the elimination of tariffs will not only increase overall exports to the region but will help U.S. exports remain competitive against China and other low cost Asian producers by eliminating tariffs on U.S. origin goods. As Congress is keenly aware, China is a major challenger in the global and regional trade arenas including the Americas.
   __label__forbarriersred;  The process of negotiating these agreements also provides a rare opportunity, and critical leverage, for eliminating non-tariff barriers in foreign markets. Non-tariff barriers are more subtle than tariffs but in some cases more damaging to U.S. exports. Trade agreements have shown themselves to be the most effective tools we have to dismantle long standing barriers.
   __label__impcomp __label__jobs;  Some would have you reject this agreement because a very small quantity of sugar is included equivalent to about 1% of the U.S. supply.

   __label__competition __label__jobs;  I respectfully encourage an offensive rather than defensive approach to all trade agreements. One that focuses on opening new markets, creating new customers, and helping make our domestic industries more competitive. Sacrificing the American confectionery and food manufacturing industry in order to exempt one commodity is not a sustainable strategy and will not result in increased manufacturing jobs in America.

   __label__intro __label__position __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__exports __label__tradedeficits;  Mr. SHUSTER. Thank you. I am the CEO of Cranston Print Works, the Nation's oldest textile company. I am also Co-Chair of AMTAC. The American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition was founded by domestic manufacturers who are committed to manufacturing here in the United States. We strongly opposes DRCAFTA because it replicates and even worsens the flawed trade policy model of NAFTA. In fact, 85 percent of the language of DRCAFTA is the same as NAFTA, and the other 15 percent is worse. This model involves the granting of free access to the U.S. market for producers that use low wage labor and poor environmental standards to undercut U.S. domestic manufacturers. In return, U.S. domestic manufacturers gain access to markets that are a fraction of the U.S. market. The DR—CAFTA consumers only represent 1.86 percent of the U.S. economy. The results of this failed model are predictable. The DR—CAFTA, like NAFTA, will exacerbate the huge U.S. trade deficit. The United States has one from a $1.6 billion surplus with Mexico in 1993 to a stunning $48 billion deficit last year. In addition, DR—CAFTA is riddled with loopholes that allow duty-free treatment for assembly of component parts from every corner of the globe. The textile provisions in DRCAFTA are even worse than the NAFTA model. These loopholes include Tariff Preference Levels (TPL), accumulation and even suspension of rule of origin requirements altogether in certain key categories.
   __label__rulesoforig;  The DR—CAFTA loopholes allow countries such as China to ship 500 to 700 million square meters of fabric for assembly in Central America that then enters the United States duty free annually. These loopholes were included despite repeated requests by a united U.S. textile industry not to do so. One hundred and forty one Members of Congress echoed this message in a letter to the President dated September 17, 2003. Astonishingly, certain proponents of this agreement argue that the U.S. textile industry needs DR—CAFTA in order to compete with China. China possesses numerous cost advantages. The combination of these assets with China's rampant use of predatory trade practices only makes China more capable of exploiting the loopholes that DR—CAFTA will give it. Thus, China is going to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the agreement, while giving up nothing in return. Even if all these loopholes were closed, a U.S.-Central American production platform will not be the magic answer. Look at Mexico. When quotas were removed for 29 textile and apparel categories in 2002, Chinese exports to the United States surged dramatically and exports from Mexico fell sharply. Despite having an FTA and land bridge with the United States, Mexico lost 75 percent of its share of the U.S. market to the Chinese in categories released from quota. Meanwhile, China's share of the U.S. market increased almost tenfold. NAFTA did nothing to stop it. Consequently, if the United States does not confront China's predatory trade practices directly, DRCAFTA will become a moot issue as China overruns the U.S. market. That is bad for the United States and bad for Central Americans and DR—CAFTA will only exacerbate the problem. Do not be misled: Voting for DR—CAFTA is a vote for China and a vote against American manufacturing.
   __label__nonrel;  Some proposed solutions: first and most important, we must reverse the current trade policy, by which all the governmentally imposed conditions of trade are designed to punish U.S. exports relative to imports. The average U.S. tariff is 1.6 percent, hardly protectionist, but our exports face an average of 40 percent. This distortion is replicated in all the other governmentally imposed conditions of trade, whether non-tariff barriers, regulation, subsidies, State sponsorship, currency manipulation, tax policy and so on. The cumulative impact of these components of our trade policy is devastating. It all goes back to the basic Econ-101 guns and butter lecture. If society taxes butter at 40 percent and guns at 1.6, a misallocation of societal resources will result; too many guns, not enough butter. So, our enormous trade deficit is no surprise. To those who claim "it is the inevitable result of globalization," I say, no, no, no! It is a self-inflicted wound. U.S. trade policy is not free trade, which is a two-way concept. It is, rather, import maximization, and DR—CAFTA is yet another way to make sure we have more imports.
   __label__nonrel;  Second, the United States should focus only on trade agreements with countries that actually produce finished U.S. goods, such as Great Britain or Italy. Third, the United States must insist that all future trade agreements share the benefits only between the contracting parties and not give any more back-door avenues to the U.S. market through sieve-like trade deals. Fourth, the United States must tackle the China problem head on. My written testimony summarizes some of the necessary steps. Fifth, Congress must assert its constitutional authority over trade policy. Instead of embracing this responsibility, Congress has severely diluted it by passing laws designed to place trade policy in the hands of the executive branch. Finally, Congress should require an independent trade impact study prior to the consideration of all proposed trade legislation. Such a study should produce a trade deficit impact statement so that Congress would know in advance whether the proposed trade deal would lessen the strayed deficit or make it worse. Thank you.
   __label__intro;  Thank you for this opportunity to testify at this important hearing. My name is George Shuster, and I am the Chief Executive Officer of Cranston Print Works, located in Cranston, Rhode Island. Cranston Print Works is the oldest textile company in the United States, originally established in 1824 as cotton printing plant founded by Rhode Island governor, William Sprague. Today, Cranston Print Works is a high quality printer of all types of fabrics with various end-uses. We employ the most technologically advanced printing production techniques, which have earned Cranston Print Works the reputation of being one of the finest fabric printing companies in the world.
   __label__intro;  In addition, I serve as a Co-Chairman of the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition (AMTAC). AMTAC is a trade association founded by domestic manufacturers who are committed to manufacturing here in the United States. Our objective is to seek the establishment of trade policy and other measures designed to stabilize the U.S. industrial base and thus preserve and create American manufacturing jobs. AMTAC represents a wide range of industrial sectors including, tool and die, chemical, furniture, mold makers, metal products, packaging products, corrugated containers, lumber and luggage producers. Additionally, a significant component of AMTAC's membership consists of producers from the yarn, fabric, dyeing and finishing, and apparel sectors.
   __label__position __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__exports;  AMTAC strongly opposes the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). Our opposition is based on the view that CAFTA replicates the flawed trade policy model of the NAFTA, Singapore, Chile and Morocco trade agreements. This model involves the granting of free access to the U.S. market for producers that use pennies-an-hour wages, low labor standards, and low environmental standards to undercut U.S. domestic manufacturers. In return, U.S. domestic manufacturers gain access to markets that are a fraction of the value of the U.S. market. CAFTA consumers, for example, only represent 1.86 percent of the U.S. economy and have virtually no ability to purchase finished goods made in countries that pay high wages and have strong environmental, labor, safety, and health standards.
   __label__tradedeficits;  The results of this failed model are clearly predictable. CAFTA will exacerbate the already astronomical U.S. trade deficit. One need only study the impact of NAFTA, which is virtually identical to CAFTA, to determine the outcome.
   __label__nonrel;  In the early 1990's, NAFTA was sold to the American public as a vehicle to substantially increase the minor U.S. trade surplus with Mexico which would in turn help to sustain and create millions of high-paying manufacturing jobs in our country. Assertions like the bold claim made below by the Institute for International Economics in October 1993 were common:
   __label__nonrel;  Mr. Chairman, eleven years after adoption of NAFTA the facts demonstrate that nothing could be further from the truth. The U.S. has gone from a $1.6 billion surplus with Mexico in 1993 to a stunning $48 billion deficit last year. From surpluses before NAFTA, we have gone to continuous deficits since. Over this period, hundreds of U.S. factories have closed and relocated south of the border in order to take advantage of the low production costs in Mexico, while still enjoying free access to the valuable U.S. market. Even more troubling, the U.S. department of Labor reports that 1 8 million workers have filed for Trade Adjustment Assistance as result of NAFTA.
   __label__impcomp;  Today, proponents of CAFTA are purveying the same snake oil. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce claims substantial economic gains from CAFTA. But in the fine print of the study, the U.S. Chamber admits that it bases it conclusions on the assumption that exports from CAFTA countries will not increase to the United States! This assumption is preposterous, as U.S. imports have increased from all countries with which we have free trade agreements.
   __label__jobs __label__fdi __label__rulesoforig;  CAFTA's main purpose is clear: make it easier for U.S. companies to outsource high-paying manufacturing and service sector jobs offshore by guaranteeing investment rights and access to the U.S. import market. In addition, CAFTA rule-of-origin requirements are riddled with loopholes that allow U.S. duty free treatment for the assembly of component parts from every corner of the globe. The textile provisions in CAFTA illustrate this point perfectly and, in fact, to that extent, are even worse than the NAFTA model.
   __label__rulesoforig __label__exports;  CAFTA destroys the existing incentives that have created the system where large amounts of American yarn, fabric and components are used in the production of apparel in CAFTA countries. It does this in two ways. First of all, CAFTA changes the "rule of origin" from what is currently in use under the existing preferential trade agreement with the region—the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA). CBTPA requires (with one exception) the use of American yarn, fabric and components in order for apparel from CBTPA countries to be imported into the U.S. tax-free. This requirement is why $4.2 billion in trade has developed between American textile firms and CAFTA apparel makers. It has become the key export market for U.S textile and apparel makers. However, CAFTA eliminates the American only requirement and allows for American or Central American yarn, fabric and components to be used in garments accorded tax-free importation into the U.S. This is not only a provision for legal non-U.S. inputs, but also a tempting invitation for illegal transshipments.
   __label__rulesoforig;  In addition to changing the rule of origin, CAFTA also contains numerous loopholes that will benefit countries that were not parties to the negotiation and did not have to give any type of concession in order to gain the benefits conferred under the CAFTA. The most likely beneficiary of this is the Chinese textile industry.
   __label__rulesoforig;  When the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) was being negotiated, the U.S. textile and apparel industry adopted a unified platform urging the Administration to negotiate a CAFTA with NO loopholes that would allow for non-regional yarn and fabric. The industry sent a letter to the President on July 7, 2003 urging him to reject any loopholes that would permit foreign suppliers to benefit at the expense of domestic manufacturers. Furthermore, 141 members of Congress echoed this message in a letter to the President dated September 17, 2003. However, the U.S. government agreed to a large number of loopholes in the yarn-forward rule of origin. These loopholes will benefit Mexican, Canadian and Asian (likely Chinese) textile businesses and their workers at the expense of workers in the United States.
   __label__jobs;  Consequently, CAFTA is riddled with loopholes that will kill U.S. jobs. The chart below outlines these loopholes and the number of U.S. factories that will likely close as a result.
 __label__rulesoforig;  Especially noteworthy is the second loophole listed above which would allow Chinese and other third-party yarn and fabric for brassieres, woven boxer shorts and woven nightwear. This renders useless the special China textile safeguard that the Administration imposed last year on these very products and is considering re-imposing this year! Thus Chinese yarns and fabrics may legally displace U.S. yarns and fabrics in the production of garments in the CAFTA countries and those garments can still be imported into the U.S. duty-free!
   __label__sourcing __label__rulesoforig __label__jobs;  To summarize, some 500 to 700 million square meters equivalent of yarn, fabric and components can be sourced from countries outside the CAFTA—U.S. region. Therefore, non-signatory countries like China gain duty-free access to the American market without giving up a reciprocal benefit. It will also mean lost contracts for U.S. businesses, closure of at least 10-15 U.S. textile facilities in the near term, and the loss of thousands of American jobs.
   __label__nonrel;  Certain proponents of this agreement argue that the U.S. textile industry needs CAFTA in order to compete with China. In other words, the only way to prevent a monopolization of the U.S. market by the onslaught of Chinese textile imports is to marry it with low-wage production platforms like those in the CAFTA countries. This will provide a "regional bulwark" against the Chinese.
   __label__nonrel;  I wish this were the case and that counteracting China was as simple as passing CAFTA. Unfortunately, believing that CAFTA will help this hemisphere combat China requires one to ignore the lessons of the past as well as current realities of trade.
   __label__nonrel;  In the previous section of my testimony, I clearly identified the various loopholes included in the agreement that enable China to ship components to the CAFTA countries for assembly. It is illogical to argue that CAFTA will keep China in check when China is going to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the agreement while giving up nothing in return.
   __label__nonrel;  But even if all these loopholes were closed, it is still nonsensical to purport that some formulation of a U.S./Central American production platform will be the magic combination of technology and low-wages to compete with the Chinese juggernaut.
   __label__nonrel;  Obviously, China possesses numerous advantages such as low labor costs, a large workforce, natural resources, etc. However, combining these inherent advantages with its rampant use of predatory trade practices is what really makes China unstoppable.
   __label__nonrel;  China is continuing to attract massive levels of foreign direct investment (FDI), including $57 billion in 2003. Its policies to attract FDI have been supplemented by industrial policies aimed at developing national productive capacity in selected "pillar" industries. These policies support Chinese corporations through a wide range of measures that include tariffs, limitations on access to domestic marketing channels, requirements for technology transfer, government selection of partners for major international joint ventures, preferential loans from state banks, subsidized credit, privileged access to listings on national and international stock markets, discriminatory tax relief, privileged access to land, and direct support for R&D from the government budget. Such policies give Chinese industry an unfair competitive advantage, thereby contributing to erosion of the U.S. manufacturing base. Many of these policies are not permitted under World Trade Organization (WTO) and U.S. trade rules.1
   __label__nonrel;  We have already seen that China's absolute advantages outweigh preferential trading arrangements and close proximity once before with Mexico and NAFTA. We do not have to speculate about this.
   __label__nonrel;  When quotas were removed under the Uruguay Round agreement for 29 textile and apparel categories in 2002, Chinese exports to the United States surged dramatically, and exports from Mexico fell sharply.
   __label__nonrel;  Exports from Mexico to the U.S. in these de-controlled categories have fallen by 45 million square meters over the last three years, with Mexican exports dropping from 85 million square meters to 40 million square meters. Mexican market share declined from 8 percent in 2001 to 2 percent in Nov. 2004. At the same time, China moved from a ten percent share to a 73 percent share.
   __label__nonrel;  Obviously, Mexico has a free trade agreement with the U.S. Mexico is in the position that the CAFTA countries will be in if CAFTA is approved. Yet despite having a free trade agreement and land bridge with the U.S., Mexico lost seventy-five percent of its share of the U.S. market to the Chinese in categories released from quota. China has clearly monopolized trade in those categories, and NAFTA did nothing to stop it.
   __label__nonrel;  Furthermore, since NAFTA, the Mexican total merchandize trade deficit with China has gone from $342 million in 1993, the year NAFTA was passed, to $14 billion in 2004. Over the same time period the U.S. merchandize trade deficit with China went from $23 billion to $162 billion. NAFTA has functioned as a back door for Chinese goods to enter the United States, as 98% of Mexico's maquiladora exports go to the U.S., and the maquiladora trade balance with China has gone from roughly even in 1993 to a $12 billion deficit in 2005.
   __label__nonrel;  In order to realistically address the China crisis, the U.S. must deal with China's pervasive and predatory trade practices directly. China's under valuation of its currency by approximately 40%, the $45 billion in non-performing loans it forgave in January of 2004, its subsidy in the form of lax intellectual property rights enforcement, and the countless other ways it subsidizes its industries need real solutions.
   __label__nonrel;  Consequently, if the U.S. does not confront China directly, CAFTA will become a moot issue as China overruns the U.S. market, taking business away from the U.S. and Central American industries. Allowing China to monopolize the U.S. market is bad for the U.S. and bad for Central Americans, and CAFTA will only exacerbate the problem.
   __label__position;  Do not be misled. Voting FOR CAFTA is a vote FOR CHINA and a vote AGAINST American manufacturing!
   __label__jobs;  In conclusion, it is clear that CAFTA replicates the flawed policy model that has lead to millions of job losses, crippled key manufacturing sectors such as the U.S. textile industry, and badly damaged the U.S. economy. Instead of perpetuating this flawed model, Congress should insist on policies that prevent the outsourcing of high-paying jobs, the destruction of America's industrial base and the exporting of America's strongest long-term wealth creating assets.
   __label__position;  In order to get our exploding trade deficit under control, we should only focus on trade agreements with countries that can actually purchase finished U.S. goods, such as Great Britain or Italy. Accordingly, Congress should defeat CAFTA and any other proposed free trade agreements with countries that will simply serve as low cost export platforms to the U.S. market.
   __label__nonrel;  Second, the U.S. must insist that all future trade agreements share the benefits only between the contracting parties. This means precluding the inclusion of loopholes like TPLs, single transformation, and exemptions for so called "non-essential" fabrics or components. China's manufacturing sector already has enough advantages with the backing of its government's massive illegal subsidy schemes. Congress does not need to give China any more back-door avenues to the U.S. market through sieve-like trade deals such as CAFTA.
   __label__nonrel;  Third, the U.S. must tackle the China problem head on. Pass legislation making it easier to file anti-dumping and countervailing duty lawsuits against non-market economies. Halt any efforts to kill the Byrd Amendment. Pass legislation that directs the U.S. government to hire more officials to monitor and litigate violations of trade agreements and intellectual property agreements. Stop the exportation of critical military industrial sectors like electronics, soft ware production, textiles and machine tooling. Put pressure on the Administration to impose safeguards on Chinese imports of textile and apparel products.
   __label__nonrel;  Fourth, Congress must reassert its authority over trade policy. The Founding Fathers gave Congress the sole authority to regulate foreign trade for a reason. Congress, and specifically the U.S. House of Representatives is the branch of government designed to be closest, and therefore most responsive, to the people. Instead of embracing this responsibility, Congress has severely diluted it by passing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status for China and other laws designed to consolidate authority to place trade policy in the hands of the Executive Branch. As a result, on critical issues such as CAFTA, the legislation cannot be amended and it is considered under an expedited timeframe that no other legislative policy initiatives enjoy. This leverage must be reversed. Congress should withdraw both TPA and PNTR for China and reassert its rightful authority over the Executive Branch in trade policy matters.
   __label__nonrel;  Finally, Congress should require an independent trade impact study prior to the consideration of all proposed trade agreements and major trade bills. Do we expect the Executive Branch, which authored the concept and the text of CAFTA to give an objective view of its projected benefits? Congress must have an independent source of information to determine basic issues such as whether a proposed agreement is going to benefit U.S. producers or whether it will increase or diminish the trade deficit.
   __label__outro;  While these are not all of the changes needed to rectify the flawed trade policies responsible for America our nearly $4 trillion trade deficit since 1990, they do represent a good start.
   __label__intro __label__position;  Mr. OUELLETTE. Mr. Shaw and Members of the Committee, thank you for your endurance today. My name is Jack Ouellette. I am President and CEO of American Textile Co., and I am also a Board member of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Our company is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and we sell mattress protectors, pillow protectors and pillows to the largest retailers in this country. I would like to talk to you about two points today, the first one being how we were able to create U.S. jobs and still continue sourcing in El Salvador; and, second, to talk about why DR–CAFTA is important to American textile companies and companies like ours.
   __label__intro;  A little bit of background. We are an 80-year-old company. Seventy of those years we were a manufacturer in Pittsburgh and we wanted to remain a manufacturer. However, in the late eighties our market share began to erode, so we decided to really emphasize products crafted with pride in the USA. Unfortunately, our buyers and the consumers didn't respond, our prices were too high, so in the mid-nineties we started to look beyond Pittsburgh for another solution and we decided to have our cutting and sewing done in El Salvador. The results have been remarkable. Today, we are the largest supplier of mattress covers and pillow covers in this country. Our company is growing again. We have replaced sewing jobs with higher paying jobs in areas such as product development, warehouse management, production planning and marketing and sales analysis. Here is a great visible byproduct of what has happened: We built a $7 million office and distribution center on top of an old steel mill, a brownfield site. The land was owned by Andrew Carnegie, who conveyed it to J.P. Morgan. We are making it productive land again. We are also part of the economic redevelopment of that particular community.
   __label__jobs __label__forbarriersred;  Why is DR–CAFTA important to American textile? We prefer to manufacture in the USA. It is just a heck of a lot easier, but we also have to be very brutally honest with ourselves, and that model doesn't work anymore. We have a strong desire to remain in the Americas, and DR–CAFTA helps in several ways. First, duties on our products would be eliminated—and, by the way, we still pay duties on our products coming up from Central America. Our prices will be more competitive, and we are going to be able to keep our advantage of speed to market because of Central America's proximity to Pittsburgh. So, I ask, what happens if DR–CAFTA passes? How will we respond? We will buy more fabric made in the United States, or made from U.S. yarns, and that will preserve jobs in Alabama and North Carolina, for example. We will continue to do business in Central America and the duty savings that we realize will be re-invested in our business, and here is how that will work. We will take U.S. fabric, or fabric made from U.S. yarns, have them cut and sewn into pillow shells. Those pillow shells will be sent back up to the United States where they will be filled, sewn, packaged, warehoused and ultimately shipped from our Pittsburgh location. We have already invested half a million dollars in that effort, and we would like to see our Central American partners grow with us in that regard.
   __label__downstream __label__jobs __label__democratization;  If DR–CAFTA does not pass, here is what we see. We will gradually move away from Central America. We will source fabrics, regardless of their origin. We know that there is India, Pakistan, China as possible resources. The infrastructure we created in Cen-tral America will decline; that is, weavers, packagers, cutters, sewers. Those jobs will not come back to the United States; they are just going to go to other venues. I would like to ask for your support of DR—CAFTA for three primary reasons. The first one, it can preserve and create jobs in the United States. Second, it makes the Americas more globally competitive. Finally, it promotes democracy and economic development in countries just south of our border, and I think that is a very positive thing for our country. Thank you.
   __label__intro;  Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to talk with you today. My name is Jack Ouellette, President and CEO of American Textile Company and a member of the Board of the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA). Our textile business is located in the heart of the rust belt in Pittsburgh, PA. We supply mattress covers, pillow covers and pillows to the most of this country's largest retailers.
 __label__jobs;  1. How contracting in Central America has created jobs in the U.S.
   __label__intro;  American Textile is an 80 year old, privately held business. The first 70 years of our history were devoted to cutting, sewing and packaging textile bedding products. One of our big initiatives in the 1980's was to emphasize products that were "Crafted With Pride in the USA". Neither our customers nor consumers responded positively. Our prices were too high and our products were viewed as a commodity. Others could produce similar products more cheaply. Our market share began to erode. In the early 1990's we forced ourselves to look beyond Pittsburgh and to adapt to changes in the world economy. We embarked on three important initiatives that saved our business from obscurity:
   __label__forbarriersred __label__fdi;  We would prefer manufacturing in the USA because it is easier. However, being brutally honest with ourselves, we realize that sewing jobs will not come back to this country. We are part of a much larger global economy, one in which the government becomes our partner in making trade agreements. We are obviously not opposed to trading with China. But we do have a strong desire to keep as much trade in this hemisphere. CAFTA helps us accomplish that goal in several ways:
   __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  U.S. textile companies are already dependent upon CAFTA countries. In 2004, 25% of all U.S. fabric exports and 40% of all U.S. yarn exports went to CAFTA countries. Between 1999 and 2004, U.S. yarns and fabric exports to the region grew by $2 billion—accounting for nearly all of the $2.4 billion U.S. yarn and fabric export growth to all markets.
 __label__jobs;  1. We will buy more U.S. fabric made with U.S. yarns because the agreement incentivizes us to do so.
 __label__jobs __label__growth;  2. Our business will grow in the U.S. and in Central America. a. This preserves and grows job opportunities in both areas.
 __label__nonrel;  3. We will reinvest duty savings into our latest initiative: making bed pillows in the U.S. Here is how that will work:
 __label__sourcing;  1. We will gradually move away from Central America and source from Asia and other low cost countries.
 __label__sourcing;  2. We will source fabric regardless of fabric and yarn origin.
 __label__fdi;  3. Our infrastructure (investments) in Central America will begin to shrink. We purchase the following type goods and services in the United States and Central America today:
 __label__jobs;  4. But please note, these jobs will not come back to the U.S., they will go to other parts of the world
   __label__outro __label__position __label__jobs;  On behalf of American Textile and other companies like ours, I ask for your support of CAFTA for the following reasons:
   __label__intro;  Mr. BURTON: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I certainly won't take the full 5 minutes. I want to apologize to my good friend, Marcy Kaptur, because we have a difference of opinion on this particular piece of legislation than we have had in the past. I was an opponent of the NAFTA Agreement, and I was an opponent of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). However, on the DR—CAFTA agreement and on the Andean FTA, I think there is additional circumstances that the Congress of the United States ought to weigh when they are making their decision, and I hope it will take these things into consideration as well.
   __label__nonrel;  President Ronald Reagan, when he was in the White House, came up with the Reagan doctrine, so to speak, and that was to push for democracy throughout the Western Hemisphere. He was very successful as President in stopping a lot of the tyrannical regimes that were running governments in our hemisphere, and he was a fighter for freedom, and he was taken to task many times for that. However, because of the Reagan doctrine, every single country in our hemisphere has democratically elected leaders, with the exception of Fidel Castro. One of the problems that we have now is we have in countries like Venezuela the possibility that you would see a return to some forms of government that might not be democratic in nature. I think that Central America and Latin America are—not a tinderbox, but close to that kind of a situation as far as the collapse of democracies. I think it is very, very important that we do whatever is necessary to make sure that those fledgling democracies in Central and Latin America continue to flourish. One of the ways to do it is to work with them in economic terms. We need to make sure that we have good trade agreements so that they can start moving away from poverty and into countries that have a middle class that will want to see democracies continue to flourish.
   __label__democratization;  I am very concerned about it right now. I am the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere of the Committee on International Relations. We have been looking at what is going on in Ecuador, where the President was removed from office just yesterday; in Venezuela, where we see the new leader down there buying 100,000 AK-47s and tanks and other forms of weaponry, which lead us to believe that he may have things in mind that aren't consistent with long-term democratic institutions. So, in addition to the economic ramifications of this FTA we are talking about, the DR–CAFTA and the Andean FTA, I think it is extremely important that we also weigh the long-term issues of democracy in our hemisphere, and what that means for the United States of America as far as our national security is concerned. We are concerned about terrorism. We are concerned about tyrants taking power in various countries throughout the world. This is our backyard. Latin America is our backyard. Central America is our backyard.
   __label__immigration __label__outro __label__position;  In addition to what I just stated, we also have the problem of a massive influx of illegal aliens should these countries not do well economically. So, I think it is extremely important that DR–CAFTA do pass. It is a stance that I have not taken in the past. I was concerned about the loss of jobs, loss of industry and all those sorts of things, but I think right now the most important thing that we have to deal with is stability in our hemisphere, and that is why I support the DR–CAFTA and the NAFTA Agreements. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   __label__intro;  Mr. DREIER: Thank you very much, Chairman Brady and Mr. Rangel and Mr. Levin and Mr. Ryan, Mr. Larson, Ms. Tubbs Jones. Let me say that it is an honor to be here; and it is an honor to be here with my colleague, Dan Burton, who just spoke very eloquently about this issue. I was thinking about what he said in referring to the struggles that we have brought about, and so I immediately remembered back to November of 1979, when Ronald Reagan announced his candidacy for President. In that, he envisaged this accord where we can see the free flow of goods, services, ideas and capital among all the Americas. Mr. Brady, you have done an absolutely phenomenal job in providing leadership on this very important part of that goal as we get toward the FTAA.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__democratization;  We have done a wide range of bilateral agreements over the past several years. This opportunity to take Charlie's very dear Dominican Republic and link it up with the Central American nations to finally create an opportunity for us to have access to those markets is very important. We all know that these countries involved have access to the U.S. consumer market today. This agreement is about a chance for the U.S. workers to gain access into these markets. The U.S. economy today—the $11 trillion economy that we have today is as strong as it is in large part due to the fact that the world has access to our consumer market. I believe that if you look at the statements that have been made by the presidents of the countries affected here, their trade ministers, business leaders, people across the board in these countries, one of the things that they regularly tell us is that, if we want to lock in democratization, the building of the rule of law, which, frankly, is in jeopardy, and Mr. Burton was just alluding to a bit of that, in some of these countries, the single most important thing that we can do for people who are struggling to move up that economic ladder in these countries would be for us to make sure that we pass the DR–CAFTA.
   __label__iprights __label__labor rights __label__environment;  For the life of me, I really have a difficult time understanding how anyone, anyone in the United States of America could oppose the DR–CAFTA. Why, again? These countries have access to us today, and we are simply seeking a chance to get into those markets. Along with that, Mr. Chairman, what is it that this agreement does? It focuses on some of the very important issues that are regularly raised as concerns here in the United States. Intellectual property is a key issue. Private property rights are very important under the rule of law. That is what we have got here. This agreement helps us address that issue. Worker and environmental rights, worker rights and environmental issues are also very, very important. We dramatically enhance that in this agreement. So, it seems to me that if we look at where we are today, the opportunity that exists for us to put into place a strong multilateral agreement and to build this strength in the hemisphere, we would be wise to pursue this goal.
   __label__outro;  China is a great competitor of ours. We are seeing competition with the European Union. If you look at the fact that we now already have, in yarn and fabric, this great rapport between the United States and the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, I believe we are in a position where we will be able to—with the implementation of the DR–CAFTA agreement—we will be able to better compete with the Pacific rim and other parts of the world. So, I hope very much that you will report this out just as expeditiously as possible. I have the honor to serve on the House Committee on Rules. I look to welcome any of the Members of your Committee before the Committee on Rules when you come, and we will look forward to a great victory on the House floor for workers and businesses alike. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
   __label__intro;  Ms. KAPTUR: Thank you, Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Rangel, especially to you for making this opportunity for the Members available. Congressmen Levin and Larson and my dear sister from Ohio, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, and Mr. Ryan, thank you for being here so very late in the day. Let me just say that I have full testimony I will submit for the record, along with a NAFTA at 10 Years report that was assembled by the Members and make that a full part of your hearing.
   __label__intro;  Ms. KAPTUR: I regret we only each have 5 minutes. I represent 680,000 people in a State of 11 million that have been adversely affected by NAFTA; and my fundamental question this afternoon is, if a trade agreement like NAFTA is not working in America's interests as promised, why replicate and expand it? Millions of ordinary people have been hurt. I am going to ask my capable associate, Jennifer Goedke, to put up the trade deficit numbers for our Nation as a whole first and then the—which, by the way, the deficit last year overall totaled nearly—well over a half a trillion dollars, and is getting worse every year. Then the Mexico and Canadian components of that, which are summarized very briefly in the handout that we have provided. This is when Mexico—Every year since NAFTA was signed, unlike its proponents claimed, we did not have surplus. We had deficits, growing deficits, and more job losses from the United States. My State of Ohio is one of the biggest losers, with over 40,000 jobs directly related to losses; the Canadian figures are similarly in the negative. So, my advice to the Committee is reevaluate what is really going on, and then renegotiate. Don't expand. It seems our Nation has been ignoring the millions of ordinary people who have been hurt, dislocated, unemployed and uprooted across the Americas due to this trade agreement. Our Nation seems to be willing to enforce anti-dumping provisions for goods but nothing to prevent the dumping of the peoples of the Americas when they lose their jobs, their farms and their hopes. Too often under these trade regimes workers and farmers have been treated like chattel, victims of great economic injustices caused by powerful market forces unleashed by these trade agreements. One by one, we have seen our industries fall. Furniture is the latest one, and this year may be the first year in which America's agricultural imports exceed our exports. This has not happened before. This is the reality that we are living in.
	 __label__jobs __label__immigration;  This DR–CAFTA agreement is an expansion of NAFTA. Eightyfive percent of its provisions are directly from the NAFTA original accord. Let me just also give you a visual image of what has happened in one of the major industries in my region, the automotive industry. Here is a graph of what happened after NAFTA. Yes, there was trade, but it was backward. Mexico turned into the export platform we said it would be, with business after business, supplier after supplier relocating. This doesn't happen in the automotive arena only, but also in steel and in medicines. Every single sector has been heavily affected. Now I would like to submit for the record a report we did. Several Members went down to Mexico at NAFTA's 10th anniversary and met with the people of Mexico. We produced a comprehensive report, and I would like my associate to place up there just one of the photos of some of the villages that we went to. My testimony verifies that not only have we lost jobs but the Mexican people's incomes have been cut. Over a 1.5 million peasant farmers have been uprooted. It is the source of the immigration into this country. It is a continental sacrilege, what is going on. People have died at our border. They have died in trucks coming across the border.
	 __label__outro __label__jobs __label__position;  What is the source of that? The source is what is happening inside of Mexico today. We were actually in La Scala, down in southeastern Mexico, meeting with these farmers, talking about how NAFTA had impacted them. What NAFTA has done to the continent and what DR–CAFTA will do, it will create more surplus pools of labor of people who are disenfranchised at home, who have nothing else to do but to flee north and to try to come somewhere where they can eke out a living. It is truly a cruel regimen. I know that my time is about expired, but let me just say that many of these families have very few options in regions like my own. Many of the people that we have met with there—we met with one villager who had come up—I never had an experience where I asked a man how old his children were and he couldn't answer me. Then I asked him the name of his youngest child, and the name of the child. The child was ill and had lived for about a month and a half. The child had no name because the family was illiterate. I had never had that experience in my life. We have to pay attention to what we are doing in the Americas. I would urge this Committee to re-evaluate and renegotiate. I thank you very much for receiving us.
    __label__intro __label__position;  My fundamental question is: if a trade agreement like NAFTA is not working in America's interests as promised, why replicate and expand it? Millions of ordinary people have been hurt, dislocated, unemployed and uprooted due to this trade agreement. Why then has our Nation been willing to enforce "anti-dumping provisions" on goods, but nothing to prevent the "dumping of the people of the Americas" when they lose their jobs, their farms, their hopes? Too often workers and farmers are treated like chattel, victims of great economic injustices caused by powerful market forces unleashed by these trade regimes.
    __label__jobs;  Americans watched as their jobs disappeared as formerly healthy industries—like auto, furniture, airline, textile, steel, high-tech, vegetable—fall one by one. As one auto plant worker from Mexico told me, " Poor countries are like crabs in a bucket. Every time one country starts to climb out of the bucket, another one pulls it back down." Or as Mexican Congressman Victor Suarez said, " We want good trade, not free trade."
    __label__fdi __label__iprights __label__;  The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), signed in May 2004, would expand the economic model established in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to five Central American countries (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Nicaragua) and the Dominican Republic. If approved, CAFTA, like NAFTA, would require its signatory countries to conform their domestic policies and practices to a broad array of non-trade dictates, for example regarding the regulation of service sector companies and foreign investors' operations in other economic sectors operating within a signatory nation's territory. It would require signatories to provide certain patent medicine and seed protections that have been criticized by health and consumer groups worldwide as undermining consumers' access to these essential `goods'—such as generic drugs. It even sets constraints on how countries and other political entities may spend their own tax revenues. In addition, CAFTA contains the same model of interconnected trade rules and foreign investor protections that together create incentives that motivate business operations seek out the most profitable sites and processes for production, even if these are often contrary to the public interest.

    __label__nonrel;  Figures don't lie: since 1994, the United States has lost nearly 1 million jobs on net due to NAFTA trade,1 with one in six U.S. manufacturing jobs being eliminated during the NAFTA decade.2 Ohio has been of the largest job losers with more than 46,000 good jobs lost due to NAFTA. U.S. income and wage inequality have gone up markedly, with the ratio of both income and wages of the top 5 percent of the income and wage distribution growing nearly 10 percent since NAFTA alone as compared with the bottom 20 percent.3 The U.S. real median wage has scarcely risen above its 1970 level, resulting in declining or stagnant standards of living for the nearly 70 percent of the U.S. population that does not have a college degree.4 During the NAFTA era, the U.S. trade deficit has risen to historic levels, and approaches 6 percent of national income—a figure widely agreed to be unsustainable, putting the U.S. economy at risk of lowered income growth.5 Though we were promised a trade surplus by NAFTA's advocates the reverse is true. The U.S. trade balance with NAFTA countries alone went from a mild surplus with Mexico and mild deficit with Canada to a ballooning deficit with the two countries exceeding $110 billion in 2004.
          __label__jobs;  2This number refers to manufacturing job loss since the most recent manufacturing employment peak in 1998 of 17.6 million, relative to the 2003 number of 14.6 million. 
  __label__nonrel;  For our neighbors in Mexico, the economic outcomes of eleven years of NAFTA are not brighter. Indeed, their sorry plight is a continental tragedy of sacrilegious proportion. Over 1 5 million Mexican campesino farmers lost their livelihoods to the dumping of commodities such as corn as a result of NAFTA's agricultural rules,' while the Mexican minimum wage has lost 20 percent of its value in real terms, and the median industrial wage 10 percent of its value.8 The jobs that were temporarily created in the country's maquiladora sector in NAFTA's initial years, as plants relocated from the United States, are increasingly relocating and losing market share to lower wage countries such as China.9 It is no surprise illegal immigrants are streaming across our border. With no agricultural adjustment promises in NAFTA, they have no options.
   __label__nonrel;  In both countries, the increased ability of companies to nearly effortlessly relocate production to lower wage countries—(as NAFTA's investor protections forbid the policies a country like Mexico might otherwise use to root foreign direct investment for development)—has tilted the playingfield against the majority of the working population who are finding it ever more difficult to obtain and maintain quality employment. Meanwhile, studies commissioned by the U.S. Government show that as many as 62 percent of U.S. union drives face employer threats to relocate, with over 10 percent of such threats specifically referring to a relocation to Mexico. The actual factory shut-down rate following successful union certifications tripled in the years after NAFTA relative to the years before.1°
   __label__fdi;  2. Contradicting Congress' Demand that Trade Pacts Give Foreign Investors "No Greater Rights" within the U.S. than Available to U.S. Citizens, CAFTA Extends NAFTA's Special Protections for Foreign Investors that Expose U.S. Taxpayer Funds to Claims in Closed Trade Tribunals
   __label__fdi __label__dispute;  The changes described above in the NAFTA country labor markets are supported by the granting in NAFTA and CAFTA of special rights and privileges to foreign investors from one signatory country operating in another. In NAFTA, these rights are contained in Chapter 11, which also provides for foreign investors' private enforcement of these new privileges through so-called investor-state dispute resolution, a controversial mechanism also included in CAFTA. The investor-state system allows corporations to sue governments for cash compensation before closed trade tribunals for claims based on signatory countries' policies that may or may not have a demonstrable economic impact on their expected future earnings. The provisions afford foreign investors operating in the United States greater rights than those available to U.S. citizens and businesses under the U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. Thus far, 42 cases have been brought before the NAFTA investor-state tribunals, 11 have been finalized, and some $35 million in taxpayer funds have been granted to five corporations that have succeeded with their claims. An additional $28 billion has been claimed from investors in all three NAFTA nations in cases attacking the most basic functions of government. The U.S. Government's legal costs for the defense of just such recent case topped $3 million, and seven cases against the United States are currently in active arbitration.
   __label__nonrel;  While ostensibly, NAFTA's investor protections were designed to ensure compensation if property is nationalized by a NAFTA government, only one of the 42 known NAFTA "Chapter 11" cases filed to date involve expropriation. Instead, investors have challenged domestic court rulings, water rights, local and state environmental policies, municipal contracts, tax policy, controlled substances rules, anti-gambling policies, emergency efforts to halt the spread of mad cow disease, and even provision of public postal services.
   __label__nonrel;  Given that these extraordinary investor rights and their private enforcement had not been part of any previous U.S. trade agreement, and that many Members of Congress did not understand these implications at the time when NAFTA was enacted in 1993, the record of NAFTA's Chapter 11 has generated enormous controversy. Thus in order to obtain a congressional delegation of Fast Track Trade Authority in 2002, the Administration offered to address Congress' concerns. Fast Track thus specified that in future U.S. trade agreements, foreign investors should not have "greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than United States investors in the United States."11
   __label__fdi;  Unfortunately, the executive branch negotiators failed to meet Congress' requirements. In CAFTA's Chapter 10 foreign investor protections and investor-state mechanism actually amplify many of the problems Congress identified with NAFTA.
 __label__fdi __label__dispute;  * CAFTA Would Allow Compensation to Foreign Investors in "Regulatory Takings" and "Minimum Standard of Treatment" Cases not Permitted by U.S. Law: CAFTA includes the NAFTA language that requires foreign investors be compensated for "indirect expropriation." This provision has been the basis for an array of cases that would not be permitted under U.S. law, including regulatory takings cases. In one such case, Metalclad Corporation obtained $16 million from the Mexican Treasury after being denied a permit to expand a toxic waste facility until it cleaned up existing contamination.12 Several additional CAFTA provisions promote regulatory takings cases not allowed under U.S. law. For instance, the Supreme Court has ruled that "mere diminution in the value of property, however serious, is insufficient to demonstrate a taking" 13 and that the entire property must be affected permanently. In contrast, NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals have found that a government action need only cause "significant" or "substantial" impairment of an investment's value to qualify as a taking.14 For instance, the Metalclad tribunal held that "expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property—but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owners in whole or significantpart, of the use or reasonably to-be-expected economic benefit of property."15 USTR failed to remedy this problem in CAFTA.
   __label__fdi __label__dispute;  To make matters worse, CAFTA allows such claims regarding types of property not subject to takings action under U.S. law. U.S. law deems public interest policies governing personal property (property other than land) to be legitimate exercises of police powers and exempt from takings claims. In contrast, CAFTA's broad definition of what categories of property are subject to compensation claims includes an array of non-real estate property such as assumption of risk and also bonds, loans, stocks, and intellectual property rights.
   __label__fdi __label__dispute;  In response to criticism that investment rules in CAFTA allow for broad regulatory takings claims, the USTR will likely point to CAFTA, Annex 10–C, which reads: "Except in rare circumstances, nondiscriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations." 16 Unfortunately, this language has precisely the opposite effect claimed. This language enshrines the right of foreign investors to challenge a wide array of public health and safety regulations not be subject to U.S. taking claims. U.S. law safeguards all public interest regulations governing personal property, yet this language reiterates that such policies are subject to CAFTA challenge. Moreover, the U.S. Government would have no capacity to affect whether such cases are brought only in "rare" circumstances. Foreign investors decide whether to file these cases. (And, the U.S. legal defense cost for just one such case, Methenex's attack on California's ban on the gasoline additive MTBE, has already cost $3 million in U.S. taxpayer funds.) Further, the ultimate decision whether or not to grant compensation in such challenges remains with investor-state tribunals on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, when deciding such cases, tribunals will reference other specific provisions of CAFTA that directly conflicts with the Annex's general language. There have been numerous NAFTA cases involving toxic substances, including Phillip Morris' threat against a proposed Canadian tobacco control law, and Canadian cattlemen's NAFTA challenge of U.S. actions to prevent entry into the U.S. of mad cow disease. To avoid future such cases and to bring CAFTA into conformity with U.S. takings law, the scope of property subject to such claims in CAFTA needed to have been limited to real estate and the "indirect expropriation" language needed to have been eliminated, or at least defined in the context of U.S. takings standards that require that virtually all of a property's value must be taken permanently to obtain compensation.
 __label__fdi __label__dispute;   CAFTA Would Allow Compensation to Foreign Investors in Cases in which U.S. Law Only Permits Injunctive Relief: Under U.S. law, both foreign and domestic firms can sue under the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution for injunctive relief, but they are not allowed to sue for monetary relief. Under NAFTA's investment rules—and under CAFTA were it to be approved—foreign investors are empowered to sue for monetary relief on similar grounds. CAFTA extends this NAFTA problem by allowing foreign investors to obtain taxpayer compensation not only for claims of expropriation,"Interim Award by Arbitral Tribunal, In the Matter of an Arbitration Under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement between Pope & Talbot Inc. and the government of Canada, United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, Jun. 26, 2000, at 37; Award, Before the Arbitral Tribunal constituted Under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Metalclad Corporation v. the United Mexican States, International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (Additional Facility), Aug. 25, 2000, at 28. The Metalclad panel stated that expropriation under NAFTA "includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favor of the host state, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner in whole or in significant part of the reasonably to-beexpected economic benefit of the property." but also based on national treatment (non-discrimination) and "fair and equitable treatment" claims—which are the trade agreement equivalent to Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses claims in U.S. law.
 __label__dispute __label__fdi __label__environment;  * CAFTA Would Eviscerate the Long-established Principle that governments Can Remedy a "Nuisance" without Compensating Polluters: The expansive definition in CAFTA of what sorts of foreign investments are subject to compensation covers government actions to prevent a public nuisance. Given the record of the related NAFTA provisions, this element of CAFTA is likely to generate further claims by chemical companies attempting to combat environmental regulation. Under NAFTA, foreign investors are demanding compensation for California's ban of the gasoline additive MTBE which has been found to be polluting scarce water resources in the state and for California's open pit mining reclamation law. Yet, under the U.S. Supreme Court holding in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, pollution that harms public or other properties is a nuisance that can be regulated by states without compensation.17 USTR failed to remedy this problem in CAFTA.
 __label__fdi;  * CAFTA Would Empower Foreign Investors to Overcome the Long-established Sovereign Immunity Shield to Pursue U.S. Taxpayer Compensation In Property Claims from which U.S. Residents and Companies Are Barred: NAFTA panels have explicitly refused to dismiss investor challenges when governments have raised sovereign immunity as a defense in investor-state challenges—apparently allowing firms to sue governments at any level regarding any issue for any amount of money. Indeed, in these cases, investor-state tribunals have accepted the argument raised by some foreign investors that Congress waived federal sovereign immunity when it passed NAFTA. USTR failed to remedy this problem in CAFTA with explicit language clarifying that sovereign immunity was not waived, thus providing an open door for future such challenges.
    __label__govprocure __label__jobs __label__environment;  3. CAFTA Would Forbid Congressional, States' Anti-Offshoring Policies that Require government Contract Work be Done by U.S. Workers; Forbids Environmental, Other Procurement Rules
    __label__govprocure;  CAFTA's rules on government procurement apply to an array of federal government agencies as well as the states that are listed as "covered entities" in Chapter 9, Annex 9.12 (b) (i). In September 2003, the United States Trade Representative sent a letter to all 50 Governors, requesting that they commit their states to be bound by the procurement provisions in all bilateral and regional trade pacts under negotiation, including CAFTA. The letter touted the potential for U.S. suppliers to bid on foreign government contracts, but failed to mention the requirements the procurement chapters CAFTA and other agreements imposed on states. Initially, twenty-eight states were listed as bound in the CAFTA text. However, since then, state officials have become much more aware of the implications that binding state procurement policy to CAFTA's rules would have on their ability to determine what procurement policies are in the best interests of the state, including policies that use state purchasing power to further social, environmental, and economic development goals.
    __label__govprocure;  As a result, a majority of U.S. states (30) have rejected CAFTA's government procurement rules and decided it is not in their best interest to be bound. In 2004, seven Governors (from Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, and Pennsylvania) rescinded their previous commitments on behalf of their states to be bound to CAFTA's procurement rules. Other states (Montana, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Virginia) declined the USTR's request outright. Governors of states that remain bound by CAFTA, including Texas and Washington, have requested that additional reservations be taken. (Only some of those requests have been incorporated into the CAFTA text. Washington's request was rejected in an August 13, 2004 letter from Ambassador Zoellick to Washington Governor Gary Locke.) In early 2005, the National Conference of State Legislatures wrote to the USTR, requesting that the USTR respond to the myriad concerns of state legislators. The Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee (IGPAC) issued recommendations in August 2004 that state legislative leaders be carbon copied on all requests sent to Governors, as state legislators to date have been cut out of the consultation process, despite the fact that in most states, the Legislative Branch has the authority to set state procurement policy. The USTR explicitly denied that request, and sent another letter to Governors requesting that they sign on to the procurement provisions of free trade agreements with Panama and Andean countries. Most recently, in April 2005, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation over Governor Ehrlich's veto which stipulated that it was the authority of the legislature, not the Governor, to sign on to the government procurement rules in trade pacts. The bill also declared invalid previous expressions of consent made by Governors, including Governor Ehrlich's letter offering to bind Maryland to CAFTA's procurement provisions.
   __label__govprocure;  State officials' concerns stem from the restrictions that CAFTA's rules impose on their ability to maintain existing and adopt new procurement policies in the public interest. CAFTA's procurement chapter prohibits many common purchasing policies, seriously weakening governments' flexibility to use procurement as policy tool to promote economic development, environmental sustainability, and human rights. These rules also apply to federal government procurement policies:
 __label__govprocure;  * Requirements that Government Work Be Performed in the United States by U.S. Workers Are Prohibited: If CAFTA were approved, Federal and state governments would be required to treat companies located in the six CAFTA countries identically to U.S. domestic companies when governments seek to procure goods and services. This means neither Congress nor state governments could give preference to domestic or local firms or require that to obtain government contracts, firms must employ U.S. workers (CAFTA Article 9.2).
 __label__laborrights __label__enforcement __label__environment;  * SWEAT-FREE, RECYCLED CONTENT, RENEWABLE SOURCE AND OTHER LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA BANNED: CAFTA requires that "a procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical specification describing a good or service with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to trade" and that technical specifications are limited to "performance requirements rather than design or descriptive characteristics." These constraints mean that procurement policies that set criteria for how a good is made or how a service is provided are prohibited—putting preferences for recycled content or renewable energy, "green" building requirements, and bans on goods made with the worst forms of child or slave labor at risk as "barriers to trade" (CAFTA Article 9.7).
 __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__humanrights;  * Consideration of Bidding Firms' Labor, Tax, Environmental, Human Rights Records Forbidden: CAFTA limits what sorts of qualifications may be required of companies seeking to supply a good or service to a government. Conditions for participation in bidding are limited to "those that are essential to ensure that the supplier has the legal, technical and financial abilities to fulfill the requirements and technical specifications of the procurement." CAFTA's limits on the requirements that can be imposed on contractors prohibit conditions such as prevailing wage and living wage requirements, as well as consideration of suppliers' environmental or labor track records (CAFTA Article 9.8).
   __label__mobilization;  4. Opposition to CAFTA NAFTA Expansion Wide and Varied, Having Grown Since NAFTA
   __label__fdi __label__mobilization;  Concerns about CAFTA's foreign investor protection by these typically pro 'free trade' associations of state and local officials, groups that are concerned about our Nation's system of federalism and the integrity of our domestic courts, has been joined by outright opposition to CAFTA from other unexpected quarters, suggesting the degree to which this agreement signed a year ago is seen not to serve the U.S. national interest. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, for one, concerned about CAFTA's agricultural provisions called on Congress to oppose CAFTA.18 These and other agricultural groups are concerned about declining farm revenue even as volumes of food trade increased under NAFTA, and that the United States is about to become a net food importer. Furthermore, these groups take to heart the claims of pro-CAFTA forces, who continually repeat that CAFTA is a stepping stone to a proposed broader Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).19 Many U.S. economic sectors views of CAFTA are tied to their analysis of how competition with Brazil in a NAFTA expansion from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego would affect their export capacity in beef, soy, citrus, sugar and ethanol.
   __label__nonrel;  Many other groups have also expressed opposition to CAFTA NAFTA expansion. Human Rights Watch has produced analyses of the failure of Central American labor law and enforcement practices to meet the minimal International Labor Organization core labor standards,2° an analysis that has been confirmed by the U.S. Department of State's annual human rights reports.21
   __label__jobs;  And U.S. Latino organizations who supported NAFTA, from the nation's largest and oldest Hispanic civil rights organization the League of United Latin American Citizens to an array of immigrant rights groups representing Central Americans in the United States, have also indicated their opposition the current terms of the agreement, concerned that trade-related job loss disproportionately affects U.S. Latinos and that CAFTA's negative repercussions for Central America are foretold by NAFTA's negative results in Mexico.22
   __label__mobilization;  Lawmakers concerned about the implications of the so-called "Arab Street" in the Middle East should also pay attention to the passionate CAFTA opposition on the "Latin Street" of Central America. Nearly one out of every 25 El Salvadorans have publicly rallied against CAFTA in the past several years, and polls indicate that a majority of citizens in Guatemala and elsewhere oppose the terms of CAFTA.23 In Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua, massive protests have also occurred against CAFTA, while it is unclear if Costa Rica's congress will approve the dea1.24
   __label__mobilization;  Officials from the U.S. Trade Representative's office have taken to threatening Costa Rica that if the democratically elected Congress there determines the pact is not in their nation's interest and rejects it, the United States will remove that nation's existing terms of access to the U.S. market provided under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). These threats continue today despite the March 2005 letter by Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Charles Rangel (D–NY) calling upon the Administration to desist these misleading pronouncements. As Rep. Ran-gel's letter pointed out, CBI is a "congressionally mandated program [whose] benefits are guaranteed on a permanent basis, unless the Congress amends current U.S. law." The representative said he would oppose such an amendment of U.S. law, characterizing the Administration's remarks as "thinly veiled blackmail." 25
   __label__mobilization;  Regardless of the Administration's bullying and disrespectful treatment of some CAFTA countries, certainly Congress would be concerned with the underlying cause of such passionate opposition to CAFTA in Central America—opposition whose protests have been met with increasing violence by governments. This includes the murder by military troops in Guatemala of two Mayan protestors—an act of military violence by the army explicitly forbidden in the 1996 peace accords.26
   __label__fdi;  The causes of opposition include CAFTA's service sector rules, which would require these nations to privatize and deregulate numerous essential services such as energy and other utilities, health care and more, as well as foreign investor protections, which would create a new set of rights for foreign investors to acquire ownership over natural resources and land and pharmaceutical patent requirements, including extended data exclusion terms, which would hurt poor people's access to medicines and take Central American governments' abilities to respond to public health crises such as HIV–AIDS. Fury about these severe threats has been exacerbated by the Administration's heavy handed tactics, for instance in pressuring Guatemala to rescind a law that would have improved access to generic, life-saving medicines or in threatening Costa Rica with removal of CBI benefits.27
    __label__mobilization;  Now major Central American political parties, Catholic bishops, the Central American Council of Churches and other mainstream, important Central American interests have come out against CAFTA as a threat to the region. In addition, eighteen of the most democratic, independent and representative union federations throughout Central America representing workers in the private and public sector, including in export-oriented manufacturing and agriculture, have demanded stronger workers rights than those provided under CAFTA.28 They have noted that the existing CBI arrangement affords concerned citizens with the International Labor Organization core rights and with the greater ability to improve Central American labor law than the proposed CAFTA's rollback CBI labor provisions.
    __label__exports __label__impcomp;  Given this broadscale U.S. and Central American opposition to a NAFTA expansion, pro-CAFTA forces have increasingly resorted to disconnected arguments and exaggerated and misrepresentative claims about the agreement. For instance, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has produced a flawed study projecting U.S. economic gains from a Central America agreement. But to obtain that conclusion, the Chamber had to assume that—contrary to the history of every trade agreement the United States has signed—the United States would receive no new imports from the CAFTA countries if the pact went into effect.29 The study's methodology additionally implies that over 80 percent of the Honduran economy would have to absorbed by U.S. exports by 2013, a potentially socially and economically destabilizing outcome if true.3°
    __label__competition;  Despite this projection that Central American countries would not gain from a CAFTA, pro-CAFTA forces have simultaneously asserted that CAFTA would save the U.S. and Central American textile industries from the end of the global textile and apparel quota system.31 Here too, their claims are wildly misleading, since experts from the U.S. International Trade Commission to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have demonstrated that China enjoys a significant technological, wage and input cost advantage over the Central American countries. This means that, with or without a CAFTA, the expiration of the Multi Fiber Arrangement quota system will result in Central America losing a great deal of its current production and employment in the textile and apparel industry.
    __label__rulesoforig;  The notion that CAFTA would affect this situation is beyond bizarre. Already under CBI, CAFTA countries' textile and apparel exports enter the United States duty free. CAFTA provides no additional benefit for entry. Indeed, CAFTA loosens the CBI rules of origin, meaning more Chinese goods could enter through CAFTA countries if CAFTA were implemented than are now permitted.
    __label__jobs;  Already, apparel imports from China jumped amount in the first quarter, and by as much as 1,521 percent in some customs categories.32 While Congress may seek to address this flood of cheap Chinese imports, this is a separate problem than CAFTA and would require a separate solution. The debate around CAFTA is not a question of "whether U.S. workers would rather lose their jobs to China or to Central America," as Carlos Sequeira, Nicaragua's chief CAFTA negotiator put it.33 Congress should instead focus on the flaws of CAFTA, which would loosen CBI's requirement that U.S. inputs be used to enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market and undermine CBI's labor rights protections, while still not proffering to the dying Central American industry any access benefits that they do not already enjoy through CBI.
    __label__jobs __label__trade deficits __label__fdi;  The bottom line in Congress' consideration of CAFTA should be whether extending the seriously flawed NAFTA model will help us create a brighter future for our children and grandchildren, and those of our continent. Even considering only the well-documented NAFTA record of huge middle-class job loss in the U.S. and growing trade deficits undermining the livelihoods of 1 5 million Mexican farmers, suppressing real median wages in the United States and Mexico, replacing living wage jobs with cheap wage jobs with no benefits—gutting the U.S. manufacturing base, coinciding with record-low prices paid farmers for the food they produce in all three countries even while consumer prices increased, and exposing some 42 domestic environmental, health, zoning and laws and regulations to attack in closed investor-state tribunals and the payment of some $35 million in taxpayer funds to foreign investors for the lost NAFTA-guaranteed profits they lost, it seems quite clear the answer is no. If one adds to the NAFTA evidence the problems caused by the CAFTA provisions that go beyond even what NAFTA requires—for instance in the foreign investor protections chapter or regarding drug patents—the answer becomes only clearer.
    __label__outro __label__iprights __label__position;  Congress should oppose this agreement simply on the basis of its intellectual property rules which are certain to undermine affordable access to essential medicines for poor consumers in the Central America. Scandalous provisions of CAFTA NAFTA expansion are life and death matters: generic versions of the cocktail of anti-retroviral drugs essential to extending the lives of those infected with HIV cost several hundred dollars for a yearlong course while the brand name patented version of the same drugs cost $5,000 per year. If the CAFTA drug patent rules would go into effect in the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, many people now able to have access to these life saving HIV–AIDS medicines and also drugs vital to fighting tuberculosis and other diseases will not have access to these medicines—either because they cannot afford to purchase them or because their government health agencies cannot afford them to provide to their public.
    __label__outro;  Thus given CAFTA NAFTA expansion's potential extension of the failures of NAFTA to people in six additional nations and the damage to U.S. residents that further extension of this model would pose, we urge Congress to oppose NAFTA's expansion to Central America and beyond.
  __label__intro;  Mr. DEFAZIO: I thank the Chair. I thank the Members of the Committee, particularly the Ranking Member, for facilitating this Members' panel on this very important subject which will have very constrained debate without amendment on the floor of the House, something that is vitally important to the American people. I would just like the Committee to reflect a bit on some of the testimony they have heard. Mr. Dreier, who, of course I am sorry he had to leave—I don't want to talk behind his back, but I remember he gave the same speech about NAFTA. It was going to bring great prosperity to America. It was going to give American companies access to the Mexican markets, and he predicted that we would run trade surpluses and we would create jobs in America. Well, he couldn't have been more wrong, could he? It has created a large and growing deficit with Mexico, and it has seen the export of hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs to Mexico, U.S. capital to Mexico, and it has not improved the plight of the Mexican people who are working in sweatshops and unsafe conditions. I have been to the maquiladora area. The environmental degradation there and the human suffering and the exploitation is extraordinary.
  __label__exports __label__laborrights __label__tradedeficits;  So, what you have is losers on both sides of the border American workers and Mexican workers; a failed model which has provided an export platform for U.S. capital to access exploitable cheaper labor and lack of environmental enforcement. Now we want to replicate that further down into Latin America because perhaps we can find even cheaper labor and more exploitable people down there. Again, it is not about exporting goods to Central America. If the countries in question here devoted every penny of their economy to only consuming U.S. goods, they didn't buy a thing at home, didn't eat anything at home, nothing, everything came from the United States of America, it would constitute about 5 days of the American economy. Obviously that is not going to happen. We are already running a trade deficit with Central America. We know that this will accelerate that trade deficit.
 __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__exports __label__enforcement;   Mr. Dreier talked about how great it will be if our textile companies could move their machines to Central America instead of having to ship them all the way to China or have to invest in new machines in China and how that would somehow be a benefit to the Americas or to America itself in its contest with China. The average hourly earning of U.S. production workers, $16.01. The average hourly wage for Honduran workers, 90 cents. They are going to be buying a lot of U.S.-manufactured goods from our country. The number of DR—CAFTA countries found to be in compliance with basic ILO standards, zero. There are no enforceable labor standards in this bill. It is just like the head feint we had with NAFTA which gave a bunch of our weak-kneed colleagues an opportunity to vote for it under pressure from the Clinton Administration. They said, oh, "we got labor, and we got the environment." They are just non-enforceable side agreements. We are going to have the same thing here, unenforceable labor standards; this will do nothing to improve the plight of exploited labor in that area.
   __label__tradedeficits __label__jobs;  This is not a partisan issue. It is a bipartisan failure. Bill Clinton delivered NAFTA, which would have been difficult for a Republican president to deliver with a Democratic Congress, much to his discredit. Those of us who opposed it predicted much of what has happened, but, in a sense, we were all wrong. It is even worse than we thought. Last month, the United States of America ran a $62 billion 1 month record trade deficit. That is going to be over $700 billion that we are going to borrow from overseas. The dollar continues to decline. We are hemorrhaging jobs in our economic base, and what are we going to do? More of the same with this agreement. How many times are we going to listen to the siren song of, all we want to do is open up these impoverished countries to become consumers of expensive, sophisticated, U.S.-manufactured products, when in reality it is all about making them a platform to export back into the United States of America, using their exploitable labor and their weaker standard.
   __label__outro __label__position;  So, I would hope that the Committee will not rubber-stamp this legislation and that we will begin to bring about a change in trade policy which will benefit all of the people of the United States of America. We can become a world leader. Instead of leading the race to the bottom in environmental and labor standards, let's set up a higher floor, and move it upward and bring the rest of the world up to our standards, instead of lowering ourselves and our workers to theirs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   __label__intro __label__tradedeficits;  Mr. PETERSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank the Ranking Member and other Members for hanging in there today. While we are here today, the Secretary of Agriculture is visiting the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota, the largest sugar-producing place in the United States; he is trying to address their concerns about DR—CAFTA. The feedback that I have received so far from those farmers, they are telling me, he still doesn't seem to get it. As others have said, we have given all these glowing promises about what was going to happen, but the reality of what is going on here, for the first time in 46 years, this year, we are going to be running an even balance in agriculture trade, or maybe even a deficit. Back in 1996, we had a $27 billion surplus in agriculture. This year, it is going to be zero. If we keep going in this direction, we are going to be in the hole big time.
   __label__jobs __label__tradedeficits __label__enforcement;  During the NAFTA debate, the Administration official promised us that we were going to add all these jobs, 170,000. It has been said we lost, the first 10 years here, 880,000 jobs. This is not surprising if you consider the agriculture sector alone, the statistics show that our trade deficit with Canada and Mexico in agriculture has tripled from $5.2 billion to $14.6 billion. Now part of the problem, I think, and part of the reason that this agreement is in trouble—back in the old days, every agriculture Member of the Committee supported these trade agreements. Today, they don't have a majority; and the reason is they won't enforce these agreements after they—first of all, they are negotiating them in a bad way, and then they won't enforce them.
   __label__tradedeficits;  So, we have got the situation with Brazil and the cotton case. We had the side letter. We had NAFTA to get sugar support, and it turned out not to be worth the paper it was written on. So, they assured us in the NAFTA with the side letter that U.S. sugar growers would be protected because Mexico would remain to be a deficit sugar producer, as they had been in the 5 years leading up to NAFTA. When the Mexican market opened up, what happened? U.S. high fructose corn syrup went into Mexico, into the soft drink industry, and they substituted that for sugar, and Mexico began to export all that sugar into the United States. Now if any of you have examined the sugar market, it is not a real market. It is a dump market created by the Europeans and the Brazilians, to some extent. Nobody can produce sugar in the world for six and a half cents. We have gotten ourselves into a situation now where we are looking down the barrel of the gun in Mexico where in 2008, potentially, we could have 5 million tons of sugar come into the United States without any way to stop it. We have been trying to negotiate this thing out for the last 3 years, and we aren't, frankly, getting anyplace. We aren't getting any help.
   __label__nonrel;  Then you go up to Canada. We have got the potato situation that has been going on since way back when we had the U.S.-Canada FTA, where we have got a situation up there where the fresh potatoes from Canada—we can't export to Canada unless we get a special ministerial exemption, which basically makes it impossible. The long and the short of it is they have got a supply management system for potatoes in Canada. They keep our potatoes out. They can bring their potatoes in. What do we do about it? Nothing. We can't get our people to stand behind us and to get rid of this obvious distortion of what the trade agreement was supposed to be about. So, because we—and I could go on and on with other examples.
   __label__position __label__outro;  So, this DR–CAFTA is going to be the same as what we have got under NAFTA. There are a lot of us in agriculture that are very concerned about where this thing is heading. They told us, well, the problem is these trade agreements would work if we just—the value of the dollar is too strong, and once the value of the dollar comes down then everything is going to be fine. Well, what hap-
   __label__intro;  Mr. LUNGREN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member and other Members who are here. First of all, thank you for allowing me to appear before you, and all of us to appear before you. I am one of those lucky enough to be selected to go to Rome this weekend, and this puts me in the proper mood because this room has cathedral-like properties. As someone who has never been on the Committee on Ways and Means, it is a real pleasure to be able to appear before you in this august setting. When I was in Congress some years ago, I recall a Member saying something which wasn't original with him but which was important nonetheless, and it was something like this: If goods and services do not cross national boundaries, armies certainly will. The suggestion was that through history we have seen that tariffs and other trade barriers presented in certain ways caused instability in regions and instability in many places around the world. This was brought very closely home, to me, when I was visited by several representatives of the Central American countries with which we are negotiating this agreement. Because I have been absent from this body for 16 years—I was here 26—a period of time of 10 years between 26 and 16 years ago, and at that time we weren't talking about DRCAFTA, we weren't talking about NAFTA, we weren't talking about trade, we weren't talking about agriculture. We were talking about guns and bullets.
   __label__development;  We were talking about the effort the United States was sustaining to try and fight a Communist threat that was supported by the then existing Soviet Union, and I had to convey to the people that visited me that was a far greater joy that I engaged in that conversation with them today than 10 to 20 years ago when we were talking about unstable situations in Central America. This is a consequence of those actions that we took back then. This is a further development of our relationship with that part of our own hemisphere. This is an opportunity for us to try and engage in meaningful trade negotiations which allow not a perfect solution to our side but a reasonable opportunity for us to establish the trade relationship between ourselves and the countries involved. Does it solve every labor problem? No, it doesn't. I was trying to find out how I would be informed as to how this House should act, and so I looked up some material with respect to one of the most recent trade agreements approved by this Congress, and that was last year, I believe, or the year 2004; that is, the Morocco-U.S. agreement.
   __label__laborrights;  I looked at the key labor issues. There it was: discrimination, or child labor, or forced labor, or the ILO core conventions, or the freedom of association, or the right to collective bargaining, or the right to strike. In every one of those categories the labor laws of the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic that are covered by DR–CAFTA are at least as good as if not superior to those of the Kingdom of Morocco. So, at least it gives me pause to believe that, upon reflection, that if the Congress believed that those were adequate protections that advanced the labor situations in that country, not perfectly, not to the total standards of the United States, but advanced from where they are, that it very well may be the case that that is what we find here. With respect to agriculture—and we have just heard from the gentleman to my right reflections on agriculture in his State, I might say that, as far as California agriculture is concerned, every representative of California agriculture that I have spoken with recommends the approval of this agreement. They specifically say that this would allow them an opportunity for a growing market and one that would be of benefit to California agriculture and, therefore, American agriculture.
   __label__position __label__ outro;  So, Mr. Chairman and Members, I would just say—I was trying to give you at least a view of someone who has been away from here for a period of time to see the tremendous change we have in the relationship of the United States to the Central American countries that are signatories to this DR–CAFTA agreement. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   __label__intro __label__jobs;  Mr. MELANCON: You are pretty good. I will give you credit. You have been practicing, apparently. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. Let me start by saying, and somewhat reiterating, maybe in a different form, former Presidential Candidate Perot during the campaign that he unsuccessfully ran for president in made a statement that has come to be reality; NAFTA would be that great sucking sound from south of the border taking our jobs away. It has occurred, and it is occurring. To duplicate that with the DR–CAFTA would be wrong. It would be wrong for the people that have businesses, the people that have jobs. It is going, and it is not stopping.
   __label__exports;  If you have ever been to Guatemala in a sugar cane field, it is really an experience that will—I am not sure exactly how to explain seeing a 6-year-old boy cutting sugar cane with his father and has soot from head to toe and he makes several cents a day, but he needs to because the household income in Guatemala—this was 4 years ago—was $675 a year. Surely, they are not going to buy a Dell computer. I doubt very seriously they are going to call Omaha Steaks and order any. I can't imagine anything else that they would need from this country that they could afford.
   __label__jobs;  I come from a sugar background. On my father's side, I am a fourth generation person that has been involved in sugar; on my mother's side, three generations. Farmers, mill managers, overseers even, that have made their living in the sugar industry. My sisters and I owe our education and everything that we have that our parents were able to give us to an industry that has been in Louisiana for 225 years. Now people will talk about the benefits and do they outweigh the downsides. Well, during the NAFTA, the people at the Port of New Orleans spoke of the 45,000 new jobs that would come to that port; 2,200 arrived. During the DRCAFTA, Mr. Zoellick talked about the 63,000 jobs that would be coming to the Port of New Orleans; and if it replicates what occurred during the NAFTA, we are going to be in sad shape. Yet in Louisiana alone, in the sugar industry, we have 27,000 people working. So, we are going to give that up on a hyper chance that we are going to get some more jobs? I don't think so.
   __label__nonrel;  When you look at the DR–CAFTA agreement in sugar alone and you realize what Mr. Zoellick negotiated by himself for this entire country and the fact that the circumvention allowed— because we, as Congressmen, who are able to represent our people in every way, shape and form domestically have no control over these negotiated agreements, other than to vote them up or to vote them down, that has taken away the rights of the people in this body to speak through their representatives in this body. When you look at this entire industry of sugar and you look at the NAFTA and you look at the bilateral agreements, you will find that in the NAFTA, contrary to what I have heard in the negotiations during DRCAFTA or any other negotiated treaty, the Canadians had the option to not participate in the NAFTA. Explain that.
   __label__outro __label__position;  Yet sugar, which is very important to this country, was the first commodity that was rationed and the last one taken off the ration list. It is going to be a sad day for me if I have to go to the sugar people in my district and tell them and their bankers that the 500,000 acres is going to go to scrub brush or back to wetlands, that those sugar mills that they have invested in, and kept running for 225 years, they can dismantle and sell for a penny on a dollar to South America. There is a lot more I would like to say, but my time has run out. Thank you, sir.
    __label__intro __label__position __label__exports __label__growth;  The members of AdvaMed join other companies in their strong endorsement of the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). This FTA will benefit the United States economy, the economies of our friends in the Dominican Republic and Central America, and our member companies that export and produce in this region.
    __label__intro;  AdvaMed represents over 1300 of the world's leading medical technology innovators and manufacturers of medical devices, diagnostic products and medical information systems. Our members manufacture nearly 90% of the $83.4 billion in health care technology products purchased annually in the U.S., and nearly 50% of the $175 billion in medical technology products purchased globally. Exports in medical devices and diagnostics totaled $22.4 billion in 2003, but imports have increased to $22 billion—indicating a new trend towards a negative trade balance for the first time in over 15 years.
    __label__intro;  The medical technology industry is fueled by intensive competition and the innovative energy of small companies—firms that drive very rapid innovation cycles among products, in many cases leading new product iterations every 18 months. Accordingly, our U.S. industry succeeds most in fair, transparent, global markets where products can be adopted on their merits.
    __label__nonrel;  Innovative medical technologies offer an important solution for nations that face serious health care budget constraints and the demands of aging populations. Advanced medical technology can not only save and improve patients' lives, but also lower health care costs, improve the efficiency of the health care delivery system, and improve productivity by allowing people to return to work sooner.
    __label__nonrel;  To deliver this value to patients, our industry invests heavily in research and development (R&D), and U.S. industry is a global leader in medical technology R&D. The level of R&D spending in the medical device and diagnostics industry, as a percentage of its sales, more than doubled during the 1990s, increasing from 5.4% in 1990, to 8.4% in 1995, to 12.9% in 1998. In absolute terms, R&D spending has increased 20% on a cumulative annual basis since 1990. This level of spending is on par with spending by the pharmaceutical industry and more than three times the overall U.S. average.
    __label__nonrel;  However, patients benefit little from this R&D investment when regulatory policies and payment systems for medical technology are complex, non-transparent, or overly burdensome, causing significantly delays in patient access. They can also serve as non-tariff barriers, preventing U.S. products from reaching patients in need of innovative health care treatments. Utilize Regional Forums to Eliminate Taciriff and Nontariff Barriers to Trade that Unnecessarily Increase the Cost of Health Care
    __label__nonrel;  AdvaMed supports international trade initiatives, including bilateral, regional and global trade negotiations, such as the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and the Doha Development Agenda in the World Trade Organization (WTO). We encourage Congressional and Administration efforts to eliminate significant tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade for medical technology maintained by many countries, particularly developing countries. Such barriers represent a self-imposed and unnecessary tax that substantially increases the cost of health care to their own citizens and delays the introduction of new, cost-effective, medically beneficial treatments. For example, the medical technology sector continues to face tariffs in Latin America of 15-20% in Mercosur countries and 9-12% in Peru and Colombia.
    __label__position __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  We strongly endorse the Administration's effort to gain Congressional approval for legislation implementing the CAFTA. Under this free trade agreement, our trading partners in the Dominican Republic and Central America will grant U.S. exports of medical devices duty-free treatment upon entry into force. This would immediately eliminate tariffs of around 10-15% applied to medical devices in these nations. Since the United States already grants imports of almost all products from these countries duty-free entry under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, we view the CAFTA as a way to level the playing field for U.S. exports.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__consumers;  Congressional approval of CAFTA legislation would pave the way for progress on other international trade agreements. Under the WTO negotiations, AdvaMed, working with other trade associations, is seeking the elimination of tariffs on medical devices and other related health-care products. The result would be substantially expanded access for our products in many developing countries, where tariffs are still quite high. Lowering tariffs on health-care related products would reduce the cost of those products to patients in developing countries and improve their access to products that enhance, prolong, and save lives.
    __label__transparency __label__govprocure;  International trade agreements, such as CAFTA, provide a vehicle for Administration negotiators to address other trade-related issues. FTAs create a council which generally allows the parties to raise a range of trade-related issues. AdvaMed believes the USTR, Department of Commerce and Congress should monitor regulatory, technology assessment and reimbursement policies in foreign health care systems and push for the creation or maintenance of transparent assessment processes and the opportunity for industry participation in decision making. We look to the Administration and Congress to actively oppose excessive regulation, government price controls and arbitrary, across-the-board reimbursement cuts imposed on foreign medical devices and diagnostics. The councils established by a free trade agreement could provide a forum to address these types of issues, which are usually not explicitly contained in the FTA themselves.
    __label__outro __label__ position;  AdvaMed appreciates the shared commitment by the President and the Congress to expand international trade opportunities and encourage global trade liberalization. We look to the President and his Administration to aggressively combat bar-
 __label__intro;  Statement of the Honorable Sherrod Brown, a Representative in Congress from the State of Ohio
    __label__intro;  Members who vote for CAFTA must accept responsibility for its impact on HIV/ AIDS patients in CAFTA nations.
    __label__consumers;  Many of these people are chronically ill now, but will be terminally ill if CAFTA is ratified. That's because CAFTA will dramatically reduce access to generic AIDS drugs. Costa Rica alone faces AIDS drug costs so steep that available funds will provide medicine for only 18% of the patients who are being treated today.
    __label__consumers;  Most people in CAFTA nations can't afford to pay brand-name drug prices for one day, much less for more than 20 years. Most CAFTA nations are struggling to fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria with resources stretched whisper thin.
    __label__nonrel;  But CAFTA responds by denying these struggling neighbors the benefits of competition in the prescription drug market.Let me quickly run through the specific drug industry concessions. Much like U.S. law, CAFTA provides for two forms of patent extension. The first one permits extensions based on delays in the patent examination process. The second one permits extensions based on delays in the drug approval process. However, while U.S. law places limits on these extensions, CAFTA does not.
    __label__iprights;  In the U.S., the extension only applies to the active ingredient of a new drug and only permits the extension of the term of a single patent, not multiple patents. In contrast, CAFTA allows extensions for any and all patents covering a drug, without any time limits.
    __label__iprights;  Here's the second concession: Because both brand-name drugs and their generic alternatives can be assessed using the same safety and efficacy data, U.S. law permits generic manufacturers to draw from the brand company's data when they seek approval for a generic alternative.
    __label__iprights;  However, to reward brand companies for compiling the data, U.S. law grants these companies a five-year window in which generic drug manufacturers cannot use the data to gain marketing approval.CAFTA provides brand companies with "at least five years" of data exclusivity, opening the door to longer delays in access to affordable medicines.
    __label__nonrel;  Here's the third concession: Under NAFTA, when a drugmaker first gains approval for a new drug, the clock starts on a five-year period in which the drugmaker has exclusive rights to market that product. The same five years applies regardless of when other countries approve the drug. If, for example, Mexico approves a drug two years after the U.S. does, then the drugmaker would receive three years of exclusivity in Mexico.
    __label__iprights;  Under CAFTA, drugmakers receive five years of exclusivity in each country that approves a drug. In other words, under NAFTA, the five years of exclusivity starts for all trading partners when a drug is approved in any country, whereas under CAFTA it restarts in each country with approval in that country.
    __label__iprights;  Finally, under U.S. law, a brand-name drug company can delay FDA approval of a generic alternative by asserting that one of its patents would be infringed if the generic is marketed. Under CAFTA, a generic drug cannot be approved unless that country's FDA can prove that no patent is being infringed. How's that for bureaucracy?
    __label__consumers;  You've got to hand it to the big drug companies. They did an end-run around U.S. laws and positioned themselves to rake in billions in windfall profits, and they used an unrelated trade agreement to do it. But CAFTA proponents will also need to take responsibility for the agreement's impact on U.S. citizens, because CAFTA will not only inflate drug costs in Latin America—it will inflate U.S. drug prices, too.
    __label__consumers;  Once the U.S. endorses additional drug industry favors in other countries, it's only a matter of time before we are forced to adopt those rules here. After all, how could we argue that pharmaceutical industry protections should be weaker here than in trading partner countries?
    __label__nonrel;  Competition from generic drugs saves U.S. consumers, businesses and governments more than $10 billion each year.The greater the delay in generic competition, the more that employer-sponsored health plans, the federal government, and American consumers will pay. Prescription drug costs are already unsustainable. Blocking competition in the drug market can only make them worse. Let me conclude with a quick note on side agreements. As Acting USTR Allgeier noted earlier today, there is a side agreement on the signatories' right to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria epidemics.
   __label__iprights;  But side agreements have no legal effect. And this particular side agreement is frankly ludicrous. Its premise is that these nations will somehow be able to effectively respond to public health crises when CAFTA itself robs them of the most effective tools to respond. For the side agreement to have any meaning, it would have to void CAFTA's pharmaceutical intellectual property protections. It doesn't do that. The side agreement isn't fooling anybody. The drug industry concessions in CAFTA are indefensible. They are also meaningless, because CAFTA is still just a piece of paper.
   __label__outro;  If enough members of Congress vote in the best interests of their constituents, or simply vote their conscience, that's all CAFTA ever will ever be.
   __label__intro;  BSA represents the world's leading developers of software, hardware and e-commerce technologies. As one of the leading contributors to the U.S. balance of trade, U.S. information technology (IT) and software makers have contributed a trade surplus of $24.3 billion in 2002. As a leading engine of global economic growth, the industry contributed a trillion dollars to the global economy in 2002. In the U.S. alone, the IT industry contributed $405 billion to the U.S. economy, creating 2 6 million jobs and generating $342 billion in tax revenues in 2002.
   __label__exports;  Exports account for over 50 percent of revenues for most of the leading commercial software makers in the U.S., including the majority of BSA members. If we are to continue the positive contributions of this industry to the U.S. economy, it is critical that free trade agreements (FTAs) establish the highest standards of intellectual property protection. It is also critical that FTAs provide an open trading environment that promotes barrier free e-commerce and growth of the information technology services sector, and require open, transparent, and merit-based government procurement.
   __label__position __label__iprights __label__ecommerce __label__govprocure;  The CAFTA accomplishes these goals, which is why BSA and its member companies strongly and unequivocally support the agreement. The CAFTA significantly advances the establishment of strong intellectual property protection and barrier free e-commerce in the region and we commend the Administration and Congress for these achievements.
   __label__exports __label__forbarriersred __label__iprights __label__position;  The six trading partners covered by the CAFTA constitute the second largest export market in Latin America (behind Mexico), and the sixth largest growth market for exports of American goods and services in the world. The CAFTA will deliver tangible benefits to industries, like ours, that depend on export income. More importantly, the CAFTA fosters respect for the rule of law, a commitment to open markets, and protection of intellectual property in a region that just a short time ago was plagued by civil unrest. Today, the region is home to vibrant democracies, growing economies and an expanding middle class. We have the highest praise for Congress' leadership in making the negotiation of this agreement possible through the approval of Trade Promotion Authority, and for former USTR Robert Zoellick and his team for bringing the negotiation of this agreement to so successful a conclusion.
   __label__nonrel;  For the software industry, strong IP protection is essential in fostering continued innovation and investment. Copyright infringements and software piracy cost the industry more than $28 billion in lost revenues last year. To promote strong IP protection in a digital world, it is essential that our trading partners establish the level of copyright protection that complies with WTO Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS) and the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT). It is also essential that our trading partners fully enforce these obligations.
    __label__iprights __label__enforcement;  The CAFTA, like that Australia and Singapore FTAs before it, sets out one of the highest standards of intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement for copyrights yet achieved in a bilateral or multilateral agreement. The agreement addresses the critical need for strong IP protections in a digital trade environment by incorporating the obligations set out in the WCT.
 __label__intro;  Some of the highlights of the IP provisions include:
 __label__iprights;  * Protection for temporary reproductions. This treatment is critical in a networked world where copyrighted materials can be fully exploited without a user ever making a permanent copy.
 __label__iprights;  * Balanced ISP liability provisions. As in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, copyright owners retain their rights in an online environment, while Internet service providers enjoy limits on liability for infringement outside of their control.
 __label__iprights;  * Protection of technological measures. Where technological measures are used to prevent copyright infringement, those who circumvent these measures will be liable for damages and penalties.
 __label__enforcement __label__iprights;  * Detailed enforcement provisions. The agreement details civil and criminal procedures and remedies designed to create a strong deterrence against piracy, including statutory damages to deter further infringement and civil ex-parte measures to preserve evidence of infringement. Critically, the agreement also provides strong criminal penalties against the most pervasive form of software piracy—corporate and enterprise end user piracy.
 __label__iprights;  * Government legalization of software. The agreement requires that governments lead by example by using only legitimate and licensed software.
    __label__nonrel;  With Internet usage worldwide topping 900 million people in 2004, e-commerce represents an important and growing part of global trade. The promotion of barrier-free cross-border e-commerce is a critical element in expanding access to global markets. The trade treatment of software delivered electronically is one of the most important issues facing the software industry. It is essential that software delivered electronically receive the same benefits and concessions as software traded on a physical medium.
    __label__nonrel;  We are quickly moving to a world where online transmission is a predominant means by which software is delivered to customers. According to our CEOs, by the end of this year 66 percent of all software is expected to be distributed online. By eliminating the need to ship physical media, this will allow software providers to deliver the newest, most up-to-date software to consumers in all corners of the globe, more quickly and at lower cost than was ever conceived possible.
    __label__ecommerce __label__forbarriersred;  The e-commerce chapter in the CAFTA recognizes a category of "digital products" (which includes computer programs), and applies familiar trade concepts to this new category. This is critical as it recognizes the evolution and development of digital products during the last twenty years, and addresses the need for predictability in the trade treatment of digital products.
    __label__ecommerce __label__forbarriersred;  Among the specific provisions of the CAFTA e-commerce chapter are duty-free importation and exportation of digital products by means of cross-border transmissions, and broad national treatment for like digital products. These provisions promote nondiscriminatory and barrier free e-commerce that is so essential in promoting the growth and development of the IT industry.
    __label__customs __label__ecommerce;  With respect to the physical delivery of digital products customs duties are to be applied on the basis of the value of the carrier medium. This provision is essential as valuation on content results in highly subjective assessments of projected revenues.
    __label__ecommerce;  The parties also agreed to cooperate in numerous policy areas related to e-commerce, further advancing the work on e-commerce with our trading partners.
    __label__nonrel;  During the past decade, a vast array of new e-commerce and information technology services have been developed including data storage and management, web hosting, and software implementation services. Given the increasing trend for technology users to purchase information technology solutions as a combination of goods and services, full liberalization in this area is more important now then ever.
    __label__nonrel;  It is thus critical that our trading partners provide full market access and national treatment in information technology services including those that are delivered electronically. It is also important that no barriers are created for the new and evolving information technology services.
    __label__forbarriersred;  All parties to the CAFTA agreed to provide full market access and national treatment on services. The agreement adopted a negative list approach, which means that new services will be covered by these obligations unless specific reservations were listed in an annex to the agreement. We commend this approach, and we are pleased to note that none of the six trading partners covered by the CAFTA have scheduled any commercially significant reservations affecting information technology services.
    __label__nonrel;  Around the world, governments are among the largest consumers of IT products and services. Opening government procurement markets to foreign trade, and ensuring that government procurement is conducted fairly and openly, is a priority for our industry.
    __label__govprocure;  The CAFTA chapter on government procurement applies national treatment rules to substantial numbers of government purchases both at the central and sub-central government level. It includes obligations to apply fair and transparent procedures in the procurement process. In addition, it requires that purchases be merit-based and technology-neutral. These elements are essential to IT industry access to important government procurement markets.
    __label__outro __label__position __label__iprights __label__ecommerce __label__forbarriersred __label__govprocure;  In conclusion, the CAFTA promotes strong intellectual property rights protection, barrier free e-commerce, full liberalization of trade in information technology services with and among our trading partners in the region, and fair and open government procurement. We commend these achievements, and we urge Congress to approve and implement the agreement.
    __label__intro;  Economic integration offers the possibility to expand trade, spur development, and strengthen democracy in the Dominican Republic and Central America. For the peoples of the region the stakes could not be higher. These countries have been trapped between anemic economic growth and corrosive inequality. The result has been a quagmire of poverty, social dislocation, and shattered dreams for millions. If these countries can break out of this trap, not only do their citizens look towards a better future, but the people of the United States benefit as well. At the very least, more prosperous economies translate into a higher demand for U.S.-produced goods and a healthier trading relationship.
    __label__intro __label__position;  The standard by which to judge this agreement is straightforward: does the Dominican Republic—Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR–CAFTA) promote development and democracy, or does it create a small circle of wealthy winners and a far larger group of impoverished losers? Expanded trade has the potential to propel the former, but this agreement delivers the later. The result threatens rather than benefits U.S. workers. It's not that the train is moving too slowly, it's that DRCAFTA is running in the wrong direction.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__fdi __label__laborrights;  Plaguing the agreement is an unfortunate, unnecessary tradeoff: DR–CAFTA opens trade while locking in the labor status quo or worse. For citizens of Central America and the Dominican Republic, the tradeoff represents a squandered opportunity; for U.S. workers and their communities, it means an assault on wages and working conditions; for firms it may mean easier access to markets tomorrow but diminished markets in the coming years. This is not an inherent problem of more open trade but rather the result of a poorly conceived managed trade agreement. DR–CAFTA provides strong language and tough penalties in all areas related to investment at times riding roughshod over the six countries but abandons labor rights largely to rhetoric and good intentions.
    __label__exports __label__iprights;  In other areas tough provisions favor special interests at the expense of the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic. Consider agriculture. The rural population ranges from 34 percent in the Dominican Republic to 60 percent in Guatemala.1 How are small farmers supposed to compete with heavily subsidized U.S. exports? Due to subsidies for rice production, the U.S. exported paddy rice to Central America at a price that was 18-20 percent lower than its cost of production.2 In pharmaceuticals, Professor Angelina Godoy has found that "the intellectual-property provisions in CAFTA actually extend the length of time during which
    __label__nonrel;  Let's be clear from the start. This is not a debate about "free trade" versus "protectionism." Instead, the challenge is defining free trade for the twenty-first century. The right trade agreement could both encourage growth and move towards a more broadly shared prosperity, defining what one might call "smart trade." To do this, comparative advantage must be defined by innovation rather than repression. Labor standards are vital for protecting workers, but they also can help expand purchasing power, build healthier markets, and lay the basis for more robust trade.
    __label__nonrel;  Why are labor rights so important? In Central America and the Dominican Republic working conditions range from bad to appalling. Workers face everything from rampant discrimination against older people and pregnant women to physical abuse, lack of bathroom breaks, and no overtime pay. "It makes me angry when they say we have good laws for workers' rights," said Marina del Carmen Leiva, a 32-year-old seamstress and mother. "In four years I won't have a job because factories don't want us after we turn 35 years of age and then what will I do?" In the meantime, the pressure on the job is so intense, she reports, that to avoid slowing production she and her co-workers are denied even a drink of water.4 The employer lays down the law and impunity rules. Wages are determined by economic power not productivity, leaving many workers and their families anchored to the bottom. What options do workers have to break this cycle? One of the few is the ability to join a union and bargain collectively.
    __label__laborrights;  What then is wrong with the labor provisions in DR—CAFTA? They send a clear message to the governments involved: the current situation on labor rights is acceptable and even fewer rights for workers will do. The agreement lays out lofty labor rights goals and then backs them up with weak, convoluted language and meager resources. Moreover, these inadequate provisions replace language that has had a modest positive impact. Consequently, firms willing to travel the low road will define competitiveness, cutting off those who want to do the right thing.
    __label__alltrade;  The economic dimensions of this trade agreement are not large by U.S. standards. The combined economic output of the six DR—CAFTA countries is roughly equal to that of metropolitan San Jose, CA and these countries only accounted for about 1.5 percent of U.S. trade in 2003. Why then is this debate so important?
    __label__democratization;  First, the region has geopolitical importance to the United States and the rest of the world. As we saw in the 1980's, extreme wealth combined with raw poverty is a volatile mixture.5 Historically it has translated into a few exercising a monopoly over political power and cycles of social upheaval followed by violent repression. Strengthening worker rights builds civil society and supports democratic governance, reinforcing long-term stability.
    __label__immigration;  Second, the shortcomings of this trade agreement could spur far more undocumented immigration. A lack of opportunity at home leaves few options for increasing numbers of people. Today, an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants reside in the United States, nearly 81 percent of them from Latin America.6 Some estimates place the number from Central America at 1.5 million'
    __label__development;  Third, healthier economies and improved conditions for Central American workers are in the immediate interest of U.S. workers. A free trade agreement puts workers in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and in Charlotte, North Carolina in the same labor market. If textile workers in Tegucigalpa suffer today, textile workers in Charlotte will feel it tomorrow and so will others in the area. The challenge is to harmonize up-
    __label__benchmark;  Finally, DR—CAFTA represents an important precedent in shaping future trade agreements. What happens here is the prelude to the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas and will prove influential in determining the ways in which countries integrate into the global economy. This agreement rewards narrow financial interests in the short term and sacrifices broader purchasing power in the long term.
    __label__intro;  In this testimony, I plan to explore five themes: contemporary labor issues, labor laws and their enforcement, the promotion of reform, the global context, and finally "smart trade."
    __label__nonrel;  For millions throughout Central America and the Dominican Republic, the issue of labor rights is not an abstraction, but an urgent need. Consider the larger political context of this agreement. Strong, unyielding oligarchies have defined most of these economies for centuries. Several of these countries remain in the shadow of vicious civil wars in which state-sponsored violence and impunity ruled supreme. The rule of law remains tenuous and civil society subject to threat. In its most recent report on Guatemala, the largest economy in the region, Amnesty International stated that "it remains concerned at the apparent lack of political will of the present government to take concrete and effective action to eliminate impunity and to ensure the rule of law prevails in Guatemala."8 The report found that "clandestine and illegal armed groups still operate with impunity in Guatemala" and that these groups are linked not just to organized crime, but to the police, army, and state institutions .9
    __label__nonrel;  Although labor laws differ among these six countries, there is little serious debate among scholars as to the situation on the ground. The issue is not simply selective abuses but a systematic denial of the right to freely join a union or the right to bargain collectively. Numerous reports from the ILO, Human Rights Watch, the United Nations, and the United States Department of State confirm the seriousness of the problems.1°
    __label__nonrel;  Why is it so important that workers have the right to join or reject a union without coercion? First, collective bargaining can address abuses on the job and link wages to productivity. Former Secretary of State George Schultz, who early in his career was a labor-management arbitrator, maintained that in "a healthy workplace, it is very important that there be some system of checks and balances."
    __label__nonrel;  Second, independent unions strengthen civil society, particularly important in a climate of impunity. George Schultz could not have been clearer when he said "unions and democracy go together." 11
    __label__nonrel;  When it comes to making the choice on whether or not to join a union, however, workers currently risk dismissal, blacklist, violence, and even death. The results are readily apparent in the low union density. In Guatemala less than 3 percent of the workforce belongs to a union.12 In El Salvador, no independent trade unions have been formed in the last four years.
    __label__nonrel;  The low trade union density is only the tip of the iceberg. The unions that do exist tend to be fragmented, weak, and isolated. Effective collective bargaining has become a rarity rather than the norm. Table 1 provides data on the percentage of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements in four of the six DR—CAFTA countries for which data is available. The coverage ranges from 1.4 percent in Nicaragua to 4.3 percent in El Salvador, not exactly a critical mass for effective collective bargaining.
    __label__nonrel;  A trade agreement should stimulate positive change, not ratify the status quo or worse. What type of labor standards might be rigorous enough to improve the conditions of work yet flexible enough to recognize different levels of development? One model is the five core labor standards developed by the International Labor Organization (ILO).13 Particularly critical are the first two: the right of association (Convention 87) and the right to organize and bargain collectively (Convention 98). The recognition and enforcement of these rights allows workers some say in their economic futures; their violation further marginalizes workers.
    __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  Although DR—CAFTA pays rhetorical homage to these standards, the approach it uses throws them overboard. The agreement calls for each country to enforce its existing labor codes, no matter how inadequate or distant from the ILO standards. The agreement recognizes "the right of each Party to establish its own domestic labor standards, and to adopt or modify accordingly its labor laws." It then goes on to state that "each Party shall strive to ensure that its laws provide for labor standards consistent with the internationally recognized labor rights . . . and shall strive to improve those standards in that light."14 "Strive to ensure" and "strive to improve"? This is the kind of language many would like to see on April 15 when they have to pay their taxes since it is virtually unenforceable. A standard based on effort is hardly a serious standard.
    __label__nonrel;  Instead of "striving to ensure" international standards are met, the agreement could commit to upholding them and provide clear penalties if they are not upheld.
    __label__nonrel;  The domestic laws often read as if they are designed to thwart the formation of unions, and slipshod enforcement hardly improves the situation. Companies wanting to avoid unions can do just about anything; workers seeking to join unions face threats and intimidation. Protection against anti-union bias is akin to snow in San Francisco; it happens but not frequently. "In practice, labor laws on the books in Central America are not sufficient to deter employers from violations," an International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF) study found.15 Byzantine regulations tend to tie unions into knots, laying out registration procedures that are more maze than procedure. In Honduras, the ILRF found "obstacles and delays in union registration constitute a violation of ILO Convention 87 on the right to associate".16 Laws encourage employer interference in union affairs, restrictions prohibit anything above an enterprise union, rights for temporary workers are truncated, and public workers often are prohibited from organizing. Finally, there are severe limits on the right to strike. Weak as labor rights are, the track record hardly inspires confidence that they won't be ratcheted downwards in response to globalization.
    __label__nonrel;  Consider El Salvador. The government-appointed Human Rights Ombudsman told the Washington Post in late 2004 that both industry and the government have "an
   __label__nonrel;  Enforcement is squeezed by impunity and corruption; ineptitude and fear. In Guatemala, the U.S. State Department concluded in its 2005 human rights report that "Workers had little confidence that the responsible executive and judicial institutions would effectively protect or defend their rights if violated." The report stated that "the weakness of labor inspectors, the failures of the judicial system, poverty, the legacy of violent repression of labor activists during the internal conflict, the climate of impunity, and the long-standing hostility between the business establishment and independent and self-governing labor associations all constrained the exercise of worker rights."20 The document also pointed out that "the prevailing business culture ignores labor contracts because, in practice, they are largely unenforceable due to the weak, cumbersome and corrupt legal system . . . [the system] perpetuates the violence that workers face if they attempt to exercise their rights." In Costa Rica, the International Federation of Free Trade Unions found diminished collective bargaining stemming from a lack of protection for union organizing.21 The labor courts provide little remedy.
   __label__laborrights;  There is little dispute that labor conditions are bad today; the real question is will DR–CAFTA make them better? In fact, it will make them worse. What makes the DR–CAFTA approach particularly problematic is that it replaces the modest existing protections for labor rights embedded in two unilateral trade preference programs: the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Much of the halting, modest reform that has taken place in the region over the last 15 years stems from the pressure brought through these programs. For example, El Salvador was put on GSP review for abusing worker rights in 1992 and labor law reform followed within two years.22 More broadly, Kimberly Ann Elliott found that "the U.S. experience in applying worker rights conditionality to trade benefits under the GSP suggests that external pressure can be helpful in improving treatment of workers in developing countries and that linkage of trade and worker rights need not devolve into simple protectionism."23 Without external pressure, it is very naive to expect any substantive change. Rather than learn from this experience, DR–CAFTA ignores it.
   __label__laborrights __label__development;  What impetus is supposed to change destructive practices this deeply rooted? The core problem is one of political will, not lack of technical resources. The most powerful incentive for change is conditioning U.S. ratification on domestic labor law reform. Unfortunately, that horse has already left the barn. Some proponents argue expanded trade will result in more democratic rights. Burgeoning trade does not seem to have done much in Mexico—especially in the export sector—in the first decade of NAFTA. Cross border trade between the U.S. and Mexico has tripled yet the number of independent unions remains in single digits. This approach certainly was not the path that the U.S. itself followed 70 years ago. Instead, the U.S. passed legislation such as the Wagner Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act in the midst of the Great Depression, hardly the most opportune moment, as a foundation for future progress. The rights workers won in the 1930s and 1940s propelled economic growth for decades to come and laid the basis for the middle class today.
   __label__nonrel;  Realistically, powerful elites retain a strong hold on the DR–CAFTA economies. If expanded trade simply translates to expanded income for these elites, a small
   __label__nonrel;  Trade among the DR—CAFTA countries takes place in a tough global context. Are strong labor standards possible in a world in which China is emerging as a defining manufacturing power? Put differently, how can the countries of this region compete with China if they emphasize worker rights? This question itself highlights a central choice in the global economy: the high road versus the low road to competitiveness. For these six countries the high road would involve competing based on innovation, response time, efficiency, and geographical proximity to the U.S. Competitive success could translate into both higher profits and higher wages.
   __label__nonrel;  "Low cost labor," a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report maintained, "is not the only or even the most important factor driving competitiveness. Studies suggest that the economic and social networks that developed between U.S. and Central American firms effectively created a comparative advantage for the region in apparel exporting that has held up even with the entry of China in the market."24 What is this comparative advantage based on? "This relationship was made possible by the proximity of production, operational efficiencies, and quick turn around times for meeting increasingly shortened deadlines demanded of large retailers." The CRS may be overly optimistic on how sustainable this advantage proves to be, but in conjunction with other policy measures it could contribute to a high road alternative.
   __label__laborrights __label__development;  The low road emphasizes the lowest possible wages and intensified working conditions. Over 60 percent of DR—CAFTA exports to the United States are in apparel, a sector known for maquiladora export plants, rock bottom wages, and fierce competitiveness.25 Although tempting for many firms in the short run, the problem with the low road is that China already occupies most of the lanes. No amount of wage cutting will effectively compete with China, which is building a far better infrastructure and, has a far larger domestic market, and access to state-of-the-art technologies. Central America needs a long term strategy that provides its' labor force with more education, fosters effective innovation, and builds on its geographical proximity to the U.S. market. Instead, DR—CAFTA encourages wage cutting tomorrow, possibly boosting profits next quarter, but ensuring a frontal collision with China next year or the year after. Not only is the low road damaging; it won't work in the global economy today.
   __label__process;  Ambassador Peter F. Allgeier, Acting United States Trade Representative, has referred to DR—CAFTA "as an important tool of reform that will help deepen and strengthen democracy."26 While the goal is worthy, the reality falls far short. The pressures were such that the DR—CAFTA countries had little choice but to sign. As a consultant for the Nicaraguan government, himself a former trade official for Mexico, put it "I advised them to sign whatever the United States put in front of them."27 This entire process has caused severe strains and protests in civil society throughout Central America. Alvaro Ramazzini Imeri, Bishop of the Dioceses of San Marcos (Guatemala's third poorest province) and president of the Episcopal secretariat of Central America (SEDAC), commented last May that "Guatemalan society is not suitably informed about the content and consequences of CAFTA. The negotiations that took place did not take into account the great majority of poor people in the country, who are represented in popular and rural organizations."28 Reflecting the gap between the ratification process for DR—CAFTA and popular sentiment is the fact that legislatures often had to pass the agreement in the dead of night. The Honduran Congress ratified CAFTA in an early morning surprise vote specifi-
    __label__nonrel;  When it came to the issue of labor rights, tough negotiating dissolved into acceptance of the status quo. The danger, according to former President of Costa Rica Rodrigo Carazo Odio, is that "corporations take advantage of cheap labor, operating in enclaves with limited links to the national economy, trapping the region in a spiral of low salaries, low aggregate value and lack of compliance with basic labor standards, such as the freedom of association and the right to collective negotiation." 30
    __label__nonrel;  The ability for citizens of any society to assemble freely and act collectively when they so desire is a fundamental democratic right. Without this right, you can have fair elections, but you do not have democracy. In fact, for democracy to flourish in this region so ravaged by social upheaval and war, one needs to strengthen, not weaken civil society. The ILO embeds these principles into its five core labor rights. For DR–CAFTA to work, labor rights need to be strengthened considerably in a fundamental arena: the decision an ordinary worker might take as to whether or not he or she chooses to join a union. The checks and balances that unions provide are essential in the workplace, but are even more central in sustaining fledgling democracies.
    __label__nonrel;  We need to reframe the debate on the issues of labor rights and development. It is not a question of free trade versus protectionism, but rather "smart trade" versus "polarizing trade." Smart trade recognizes rights, spurs economic growth with equity, and promotes democracy; polarizing trade might spur trade in the short run but the benefits go to the winners' circle while the number of losers grows far larger. Democracy itself could be a casualty.
 __label__nonrel;  1. Upward harmonization of domestic labor law to match the core ILO conventions as the goal of a three-year phase-in period. The granting of trade and investment benefits would follow agreed upon reform in a country's labor law.31
 __label__nonrel;  2. The ILO five core labor rights embedded in the core agreement, subject to strong enforcement provisions and penalties.
 __label__nonrel;  3. A development fund targeted for infrastructure and education. This fund would reinforce competitiveness in the six countries and place them on the "high road."
 __label__nonrel;  4. Expanded adjustment assistance for U.S. workers negatively impacted by trade. This assistance should also be proactive in industries threatened by trade.
    __label__outro __label__position;  No trade agreement can solve all the problems of development and globalization, but it should point in the right direction. A trade agreement that fosters prosperity and promotes democracy is possible and essential for the region and for the United States. Smart trade lays the basis for growing incomes and markets in Central America and the Dominican Republic and expanded U.S. exports and jobs. It begins to define a better model for integrating into the global economy. Unfortunately, that model is not this DR–CAFTA.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  The Intellectual Property (1P) provisions of the Dominican Republic—Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) would delay competition from generic medicines, helping to prop up high prices for brand name pharmaceuticals in the U.S., and effectively denying access to life-saving drugs in some of the poorest nations in the Americas. CAFTA IP provisions that would discourage generic competi-
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  These provisions contradict Congress' objectives in the Trade Act of 2002 to balance its interest in strengthening intellectual property rules with its interest in assuring access to affordable drugs. They reflect the published views of the U.S. Trade Representative's Advisory Committee on Intellectual Property Rights. Seven of 15 members of this Committee are affiliated with the pharmaceutical industry. There are no representatives of organizations concerned with the effects of trade on health. Addenda to this testimony document the IP Committee's comments and membership.
    __label__iprights;  CAFTA would establish rules for trade among seven nations: the U.S., Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. The rules apply to both the U.S. and to Central American countries. A side letter to the agreement on public health does not protect access to medicines.
    __label__iprights;  CAFTA's IP rules extend two types of intellectual property rights that brand name companies now use to maintain monopoly control on the sale of prescription drugs: 1) Patents; and 2) Clinical trial test data. Generic competitors need to refer to these data to get regulatory approval for marketing. CAFTA's data exclusivity rules present an insurmountable barrier to a third key policy, compulsory licensing.

According to Doctors Without Borders, generic competition led to a dramatic drop in cost for antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS in Guatemala. In the first half of 2000, the lowest cost of treatment was $10,439 per year per person for brand-name drugs and $2,767 for generics. In less than a year, the price dropped to $727 for brand-name drugs and $201 for generics.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  The Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 (PL 107-210; 19 USC 3802, Sec. 2102.(b)(4)(C), Trade Negotiating Objectives) calls on the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to balance Congress' interests in strengthening intellectual property rules, and in assuring access to affordable drugs. It calls for the U.S. to respect the World Trade Organization's Doha Declaration, which recognizes that trade agreements must support a nation's "right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all." The USTR's Advisory Committees are an important conduit for views from the concerned public, and could help balance these interests. However, there are no representatives for the public's health or for access to medicines on any of the USTR's Advisory Committees, including those that address intellectual property negotiations. Seven of 15 members of the Industry Trade Advisory Committee on Intellectual Property Rights (ITAC 15) are affiliated with the pharmaceutical industry. There are no representatives of organizations concerned with the impact of trade agreements on the health of individuals, communities, and vulnerable populations.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  These advisory committees routinely advocate intellectual property provisions that delay and deny access to affordable drugs in the U.S. and abroad, while extending pharmaceutical company rights beyond U.S. patent law and the WTO TRIPS Agreement (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property). They are referred to as "TRIPS—Plus" rules. There has been opposition to these policies in the U.S. and in our trading partners. Because there is no public health representation on the advisory committees, and trade negotiations are secret until the agreements are completed, this opposition has been expressed only after it has been too late to influence the agreement. Better representation during the process would contribute to more effective outcomes.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  A side letter to CAFTA, "Understanding Regarding Certain Public Health Measures," does not protect access to affordable prescription drugs, including generics. As documented elsewhere by CPATH (www.cpath.org), the side letter's language leaves important loopholes about which government measures to provide medicines would be considered sufficiently "necessary" or urgent. Language that protects access to medicines should be unambiguous, should conform entirely with the spirit and letter of the World Trade Organization's Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, and should be included in the main text of the agreement. 1P provisions that could restrict access to affordable medicines should not be included in regional and bilateral trade agreements.
    __label__iprights;  1. CAFTA would cover plants as patentable. Patents of plants may directly impact the economic livelihood and health of local farmers who have traditionally depended on their knowledge of and access to medicinal and nutritional plants. Under CAFTA they may be required to pay transnational corporations that patent plants. Patenting of plants is not required by TRIPS.
    __label__iprights;  CAFTA Provision: Article 15.9: 2. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from excluding inventions from patentability as set out in Articles 27.2 and 27.3 of the TRIPS Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party that does not provide patent protection for plants by the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall undertake all reasonable efforts to make such patent protection available. Any Party that provides patent protection for plants or animals on or after the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall maintain such protection.
    __label__iprights;  2. CAFTA gives very limited rights to provide exceptions to patents. The Bolar Amendment in the U.S. authorizes generic companies to prepare for marketing approval in advance of the expiration of a patent, so that generic products may be available when the patent expires. Under CAFTA's weak language, a country "may provide" exceptions, suggesting it also may not, particularly if there is continuing pressure from U.S. not to do so.
    __label__iprights;  15.9.3. A Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.
    __label__iprights;  3. Export of a generic appears to be prohibited, even if a patent has expired. U.S. law explicitly permits the export of a generic pharmaceutical product once the patent has expired regardless of the existence of marketing exclusivity.

Consistent with paragraph 3, if a Party permits a third person to use the subject matter of a subsisting patent to generate information necessary to support an application for marketing approval of a pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical product, that Party shall provide that any product produced under such authority shall not be made, used, or sold in the territory of that Party other than for purposes related to generating information to meet requirements for approval to market the product once the patent expires, and if the Party permits exportation, the prod-
    __label__iprights;  4. CAFTA extends patents by up to 5 years from the date of filing a patent application in a country (beyond the 20 year patent term) for unjustified delays that may occur during the process of granting a patent. This could extend patents after the patent has expired in U.S.
    __label__iprights;  This provision is independent from and cumulative to a related provision that requires extension of length of patent term for an indeterminate period, to compensate a patent holder for unreasonable reduction of patent term due to market approval process. "Unreasonable" is not defined. No clear criteria exist for determining the extension. No maximum period for the patent extension is specified. The clock can start after the patent expires in U.S.
    __label__iprights;  CAFTA Provisions. Article 15.96. (a) Each Party, at the request of the patent owner, shall adjust the term of a patent to compensate for unreasonable delays that occur in granting the patent. For purposes of this paragraph, an unreasonable delay shall at least include a delay in the issuance of the patent of more than five years from the date of filing of the application in the territory of the Party, or three years after a request for examination of the application has been made, whichever is later, provided that periods attributable to actions of the patent applicant need not be included in the determination of such delays.
    __label__iprights;  15.9.6 (b) With respect to any pharmaceutical product that is covered by a patent, each Party shall make available a restoration of the patent term to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term resulting from the marketing approval process related to the first commercial marketing of the product in that Party.
    __label__iprights;  Generics manufacturers must be able to refer to the originator company's clinical trial data, presented to regulatory authorities to establish that the drug is safe and effective. Once the originator's drug is approved, a generic company only needs to show that its product is biologically equivalent, meaning that it works the same way in the human body as the originator's drug. If it cannot refer to the approval of the originator drug, it cannot obtain approval for marketing. A combination of CAFTA rules delay generic companies' ability to rely on originators' approvals.
    __label__iprights;  1. No approval will be given to a generics manufacturer to use test data for marketing a generic product for at least 5 years for pharmaceutical products and 10 years for agricultural chemical products from the first approval of the patented drug in that country.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  Delay in marketing. If generic companies cannot rely on approvals based on pharmaceutical data from the brand drugs, they will effectively be barred from the market for years. Repeating the safety and efficacy tests required to obtain marketing approval would be costly, and expose human subjects to unnecessary and therefore unethical risk.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  Multiple delays for indeterminate times. CAFTA prohibits generic companies from preparing generic drugs for marketing until at least 5 years—possibly an undefined longer term—for pharmaceutical products after approval is given to the originator drug company in the new country. The clock can therefore start after the patent expires in the U.S. These provisions also apply even when there is no patent in effect in a country.
    __label__iprights;  Under TRIPS 39.3, test data can be protected only when national authorities require their presentation as a condition of marketing approval. Countries must protect undisclosed pharmaceutical test data from "unfair" commercial use. If a country accepts reference to approval given in a foreign country, there is no obligation to protect test data.
    __label__iprights;  De facto barrier to compulsory licensing. This is a de facto prohibition of compulsory licensing for at least 5 years for pharmaceutical products. This is because there is no provision for issuing a compulsory license (CL) to override data protection. Such a CL can only be issued to override a patent, which is a separate right.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  Countries can issue a "compulsory license" to compel generic production of a patented drug, in order to make the drug more widely available at an affordable price. In most cases, a government's credible threat to issue a compulsory license has induced brand-name companies to drastically lower their prices. Bayer lowered its price for Cipro after the U.S. threatened to issue a compulsory license for Cipro during the anthrax scare, for example. Under CAFTA, it is possible that countries could still overcome the originator company's patent right. But CAFTA's "data exclusivity" provisions present an insurmountable barrier to a generic company's ability to refer to the originator company's clinical trial data for marketing approval, and thus are a barrier to compulsory licensing.
   __label__iprights;  CAFTA Provision: Article 15.10: Measures Related to Certain Regulated Products. 1. (a) If a Party requires, as a condition of approving the marketing of a new pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical product, the submission of undisclosed data concerning safety or efficacy, the Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of the person who provided the information, to market a product on the basis of (1) the information, or (2) the approval granted to theperson who submitted the information for at least five years for pharmaceutical products and ten years for agricultural chemical products from the date of approval in the Party.
   __label__nonrel;  Question for USTR: CAFTA would delay competition by generic drug companies by many years, and prevent governments from issuing or threatening to issue compulsory licenses. How does this benefit consumers of drugs in the U.S. and other CAFTA countries? Why does it contradict the Doha Declaration, which authorizes governments to protect public health and access to medicines?
   __label__iprights;  2. CAFTA extends the protection of test data beyond the signatories to the CAFTA agreement. It prevents reliance on test data which was previously presented to any foreign country in the world ("another territory"). It prevents reliance on prior approval of a drug in any foreign country, for at least 5 years for pharmaceutical products and 10 years for agricultural chemical products. The protection starts from the date that the patent holder seeks approval of the drug in a CAFTA country.
   __label__iprights;  For example, a brand name company may have a product on the market in the U.S., but not in Guatemala. Guatemala could not authorize generic versions of the product for at least 5 years from a future date when the brand name company seeks approval in Guatemala. A country can require that the innovator company request approval within 5 years after obtaining marketing approval in another country, but does not have to do so. If a brand name company seeks marketing approval in Guatemala, for example, in the fifth year, this would delay authorization of a generic product for 10 years total (5 years due to marketing approval in the U.S., plus an additional 5 years after marketing approval is sought in Guatemala).
   __label__iprights;  These provisions may also apply even if the patent holder has no patent or marketing approval in a CAFTA country.
   __label__iprights;  These provisions also create barriers to compulsory licensing during emergencies. As noted above, during the anthrax scare in the U.S., the threat by 11115 to issue a compulsory license for the antibiotic Cipro induced Bayer, the manufacturer, to drastically reduce its price. Under CAFTA a generic licensee could not use the safety and efficacy data from Bayer or rely on its previous regulatory approval, but also would not have had time to repeat Bayer's clinical trials.
   __label__iprights;  CAFTA Provision: 1 5.1 0.1 (b) If a Party permits, as a condition of approving the marketing of a new pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical product, third persons to submit evidence concerning the safety or efficacy of a product that was previously approved in another territory, such as evidence of prior marketing approval, the Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of the person who previously obtained such approval in the other territory, to obtain authorization or to market a product on the basis of

Under TRIPS, data protection applies to new chemical entity, not to an undefined new product.Test data protection does not apply to second uses, new formulations or changes in doses. Under TRIPS, a country can require a drug company seeking test data protection to prove that this is the result of a substantial investment.
   __label__iprights;  CAFTA Provision. 15.10.1. (c) For purposes of this paragraph, a new product is one that does not contain a chemical entity that has been previously approved in the territory of the Party.
   __label__iprights;  CAFTA links the registration of drugs with the existence of a patent for a pharmaceutical product. The terms "shall implement measures . . . to prevent" requires the country's drug regulatory agency, which is responsible for ensuring safety and efficacy, to take on the additional responsibility of legal enforcement of existing patents. There are typically many patents associated with a single drug, administered by a patent office. Neither the U.S. nor Central American countries have the administrative capacity to coordinate patent office functions with drug regulatory authorities.
   __label__iprights;  In the U.S., the FDA informs patent holders through the so-called "Orange Book" about requests made by third parties regarding the same drug. The patent holder bears the responsibility to ensure that its intellectual property right is not violated. The patent holder can take the case to court to stop an application for registering a generic drug.
   __label__iprights;  CAFTA Provision: 15.10.2. Where a Party permits, as a condition of approving the marketing of a pharmaceutical product, persons, other than the person originally submitting safety or efficacy information, to rely on evidence or information concerning the safety and efficacy of a product that was previously approved, such as evidence of prior marketing approval in the territory of a Party or in another country, that Party:
   __label__iprights;  15.10.2. (a) shall implement measures in its marketing approval process to prevent such other persons from marketing a product covered by a patent claiming the previously approved product or its approved use during the term of that patent, unless by consent or acquiescence of the patent owner; and (b) shall provide that the patent owner shall be informed of the request and the identity of any such other person who requests approval to enter the market during the term of a patent identified as claiming the approved product or its approved use.
   __label__iprights __label__consumers __label__outro;  CAFTA presents numerous new obstacles to competition by generic drug companies. These provisions in many cases exceed the requirements of TRIPS and U.S. law. CAFTA would delay access to life-saving generic drugs by many years, and contribute to additional deaths from HIV/AIDS and other conditions. The legal architecture established by CAFTA will maintain higher drug prices in the U.S.
   __label__position;  CAFTA fails to respect Congress' negotiating objective to implement the Doha Declaration on public health and access to medicines. Instead, it advances monopoly rights for pharmaceutical companies that maintain high drug prices. It reflects the opinions of the USTR advisory committees, which include numerous pharmaceutical company representatives, and no representatives of public health.
   __label__intro;  The Coalition of Service Industries (CSI) is pleased to have this opportunity to submit comments for the record on the U.S.-DR–CAFTA Free Trade Agreement.
   __label__intro __label__position __label__exports;  CSI strongly supports the U.S.-DR–CAFTA trade agreement, and we hope that Congress will approve it promptly. The Agreement provides for meaningful liberalization of trade and investment in services between the United States and the DRCAFTA countries, and will open up new markets and opportunities for U.S. companies across a range of service industries. It will also demonstrate to other developing countries, in this hemisphere and elsewhere, that commitments to liberalization and internal economic reform are necessary for economic development, higher standards of living, and global competitiveness.
   __label__position __label__fdi;  The Agreement does not meet industry objectives in all respects; for example, the lack of temporary entry provisions. Notwithstanding, both the United States and the Central American nations stand to gain significantly from this Agreement, and it unquestionably merits Congressional approval.
   __label__intro;  The DR–CAFTA Agreement and its merits should be viewed against the role services play in the U.S. economy. Services account for the overwhelming share of U.S. employment and economic output, and a large and growing share of our foreign trade. As Congressmen Kolbe and Cardin pointed out in a March 18, 2005 Dear Colleague letter, services "are key to the future growth of the American Economy."
   __label__intro;  Services jobs represent approximately 80% of all non-farm, non-government workers in the U.S. Between 1993 and the 2003, the service sector added 17 million new U.S. jobs, and of the 19 2 million new American jobs forecast to be created by 2012, 90% will be in the service sector. Moreover, the service sector generates 78% of U.S. private sector GDP. Efficient, high-quality services are crucial inputs into the production of virtually all products. The price and quality of services influences the costs and productivity of all sectors, including manufacturing and agriculture.
   __label__exports __label__competition __label__growth;  The magnitude of U.S. services trade is under-appreciated. Last year, U.S. crossborder exports of services were $338 billion, up from $307 billion the previous year, and represented about 40% of the value of U.S. merchandise exports. The $49 billion services trade surplus that the U.S. ran last year partially offset our merchandise trade deficit. An even larger share of U.S. services trade is delivered through the foreign affiliates of U.S. parent companies. In 2002, the services sales of U.S. foreign affiliates worldwide reached slightly over $400 billion. These foreign operations are crucial to U.S. companies' competitiveness in global markets. Thus, expanded market access under DR–CAFTA will help U.S. companies become even more competitive in the global marketplace.
    __label__competition;  The U.S. is extremely competitive across the range of services sectors, from banking and financial services to insurance, computer and related services, entertainment and audio visual services, express delivery, architecture and engineering, and others. The liberalization of these areas, as provided for in the Agreement, thus plays to a U.S. strong suit.
    __label__fdi;  During negotiations, every effort was made to ensure that CAFTA's services coverage was comprehensive, with minimal reservations taken. Under CAFTA, services trade and investment will be liberalized on a "negative list" basis, which requires that a country list in detail the activities which will be excluded from liberalization. This approach is absolutely crucial to ensuring truly comprehensive coverage. The negative list has the further major advantage that new services are automatically free, which is particularly important in the services sector where new services are regularly being created. This was a significant achievement on the part of U.S. negotiators, given the reluctance of the CAFTA countries to negotiate on that basis at the outset of the talks. Moreover, important concessions have been obtained in the context of political controversy in some of the CAFTA countries. For example, the liberalization of insurance and telecommunications services in Costa Rica were particularly sensitive issues in that country.
    __label__transparency __label__fdi;  The agreement contains important provisions for services-related investment, regulatory transparency, and for trade in key service sectors. These are discussed below.
    __label__nonrel;  CSI represents the interests of the dynamic American service economy, which employs 80% of the U.S. workforce and generates a similar proportion of national economic output. CSI was formed in 1982 to ensure that U.S. trade in services, once considered outside the scope of U.S. trade negotiations, would become a central goal of future trade liberalization initiatives. CSI has been actively engaged in, and a strong supporter of, services negotiations in the WTO, as well as in our regional and bilateral free trade agreements, including the DR—CAFTA Agreement.
    __label__nonrel;  The broad range and diversity of the U.S. service economy is reflected in CSI's membership, which includes major international companies from the banking, insurance, telecommunications, information technology, travel and tourism, transportation, and diversified management service sectors. CSI members conduct business in more than 100 countries, have global sales of about $800 billion, and employment of about 2.3 million
    __label__fdi;  The Agreement will help promote a secure and predictable legal framework for U.S. investors in Central America and the Dominican Republic. Such provisions are particularly important to service providers, for whom a local presence is often required to supply services.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__fdi;  The Agreement reduces barriers to U.S. investment. It assures U.S. investors greater opportunities to establish, acquire and operate investments in each of the Central American countries in all sectors. Such investors are to be accorded equal treatment with local investors and may not be subjected to special or discriminatory requirements for the use of local inputs, export obligations, or to extend licenses to local companies. Rights to manage and direct such investments with personnel other than from the host country are also provided.
    __label__fdi __label__dispute;  The Agreement ensures the protection of U.S. investment. It includes a broad definition of investment, the guarantee of prompt, adequate and effective compensation for expropriation, fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, the free transfer of capital, no performance requirements, as well as the national treatment and most-favored nation provisions. Very importantly, the Agreement includes the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism that is vital to afford U.S. investors the opportunity to ensure that their investments are protected against arbitrary, discriminatory and unfair government actions.
    __label__consumers;  At the same time, the Agreement protects the legitimate exercise of each government's regulatory authority to protect "public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, and the environment."
    __label__transparency;  The Agreement provides for a high standard of transparency in administrative, licensing, and adjudicatory proceedings. Transparency in regulatory processes is absolutely essential for services industries, because they generally are the most highly regulated. A government's regulations governing financial services, energy services, and professional services, for example, can vitiate or nullify trade agreements that would otherwise provide full market access and national treatment.
    __label__transparency __label__fdi;  The overarching provisions in the introductory chapter on transparency require the essentials: the designation of a contact point for inquiries, the requirement for
    __label__exports;  Dealer Protection: The Agreement addresses restrictions on distribution in Central America created through restrictive dealer protection regimes. Such regimes have placed substantial burdens on the distribution of U.S. exports to the region by locking U.S. companies into inefficient, exclusive and effectively permanent relationships, oftentimes regardless of the performance of the local dealer. The Agreement will allow U.S. exporters and their dealers freedom to contract the terms of their relationships. These provisions will substantially help promote more efficient and improved distribution for U.S. companies within the region.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Accounting Services: The Agreement provides for U.S. accountants to obtain local qualifications and licenses on a reciprocal basis.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Architecture: The Agreement's provisions on the development of professional standards, and temporary licensing and review, provide for equity and reciprocity in this sector. Further provisions provide access to the Central American markets while promoting capacity building within the profession.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Asset Management Services The Agreement provides legal certainty that U.S. asset management firms will be afforded national treatment, non-discrimination and the right of establishment. It also permits cross-border provision of portfolio management services by asset managers of mutual funds. The financial services transparency commitments in the agreement also would benefit the asset management industry.
    __label__iprights __label__enforcement;  Audiovisual Services: The Agreement provides for strong intellectual property protections, and strengthened enforcement. The FTA demonstrates that a trade agreement can harmonize two important objectives—trade liberalization and the promotion of cultural diversity. It avoids the "cultural exceptions" approach, while demonstrating that a trade agreement has sufficient flexibility to take into account countries' cultural promotion interests. The Agreement includes important provisions to ensure market access for U.S. films and television programs over a variety of media including cable, satellite, and the Internet. It provides for zero tariffs on audio visual products, reaffirms that customs duties are based on the value of carrier media and not the value of the movie or other content. It provides commitments to non-discriminatory treatment of digital products including DVDs and CDs, and agreement not to impose customs duties on such products.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Computer and Related Services: The Agreement ensures full market access and national treatment for computer and related services. The Agreement covers all modes of delivery, including electronic delivery. The "negative list" approach ensures that rapidly evolving computer services, driven by continual advances in technology, will automatically be covered by the Agreement.
    __label__ecommerce;  Electronic Commerce: The Agreement includes important language on electronic commerce. As with previous FTAs, the Agreement establishes the concept of "digital products"; prevents the application of customs duties on electronically-delivered digital products; assures the non-discriminatory treatment of digital products; addresses the valuation of physically delivered digital products; and provides commitments to cooperate on electronic commerce policy.
    __label__transparency;  Energy Services: The Agreement's provisions on regulatory transparency and investment provide a framework that can provide opportunities for U.S. energy services firms and facilitate the provision of energy services between the United States and Central America.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__customs;  Express Delivery Services: The Agreement includes important provisions for the sector, including an appropriate definition of express delivery services (EDS). The Agreement recognizes EDS as a unique service sector and contains important commitments to maintain market access for the industry and to facilitate customs clearance, which is critical to the efficient operation of express carriers. The Agreement includes significant language proscribing monopoly abuse by postal administrations when they compete in the supply of express delivery services.
    __label__fdi __label__transparency;  Financial Services (other than insurance and asset management): The Agreement contains important provisions relating to branching, pension management and regulatory transparency.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Healthcare Services: the Agreement breaks new ground concerning the temporary licensing of physicians and surgeons that will be helpful for U.S. hospitals engaged in international medical care to gain market presence.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Insurance: The Agreement's insurance commitments are comprehensive and provide good treatment for insurance. While these countries already have fairly open insurance markets, in most cases these insurance commitments are significant improvements over current WTO obligations. Perhaps most significantly, Costa Rica's insurance sector, which is currently dominated by a monopoly, will be opened for the first time under this agreement. All major aspects of insurance are covered, including life, non-life, reinsurance, intermediation and services auxiliary to insurance. Similarly, key cross border insurance products and services are covered (marine, aviation and transport (MAT), reinsurance and intermediation).
    __label__nonrel;  Legal Services: The Agreement preserves the ability of U.S. lawyers to serve as foreign legal consultants or otherwise to provide advice and assistance respecting the law they are authorized to practice in the United States.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Telecommunications: The Agreement includes new international cost-oriented interconnection obligations for fixed traffic (although mobile services, unfortunately, are excluded from this obligation). The Agreement also contains commitments to provide access to and use of telecommunications networks, and commitments for fixed services, including competitive safeguards, interconnection, universal service, licensing, independent regulator, and allocation of scarce resources. "WTO—Plus" obligations are incurred for major suppliers with respect to resale, provisioning of leased circuits and collocation. The Agreement includes new market access commitments, including cross-border obligations.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Vessel Repair: the Agreement provides for the elimination of the 50% U.S. tariff on vessel repairs performed in the Central American countries, thus eliminating a significant burden on U.S. shipping companies that require repair work when servicing foreign markets.
    __label__outro __label__position;  The DR—CAFTA Agreement provides for substantial new market access for a broad range of U.S. services industries to a growing market of nearly 45 million consumers. It thus opens up significant new opportunities for U.S. services trade and investment, and deserves prompt approval by the Congress.
    __label__intro;  Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is pleased to submit this testimony to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives about the potential negative consequences of intellectual property (1P) provisions in the United States-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR—CAFTA) on access to essential medicines in the concerned countries.
   __label__position __label__iprights __label__consumers;  MSF is deeply concerned that provisions in the Chapter on Intellectual Property in DR—CAFTA1 will lead to devastating consequences in terms of access to medicines for millions of people in the region with HIV/AIDS and other diseases. MSF is also concerned that this trade agreement, among others already signed or currently being negotiated, undermines the right and obligation of countries to protect public health and promote access to medicines for all, in accordance with the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Public Health ("Doha Declaration"), which the U.S. adopted along with all other WTO members in November
   __label__nonrel;  MSF has called repeatedly on the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to ensure that the Doha Declaration remains a ceiling for trade negotiations on IP as they relate to public health technologies. Because of the clearly stated negotiating objectives of the U.S., however, we have been forced to go one step further in recommending that 1P be excluded from bilateral and regional trade agreements altogether. The WTO TRIPS Agreement already establishes more than sufficient standards for 1P protection in WTO member states.
   __label__nonrel;  Specifically, MSF has raised concerns about the following IP provisions in various FTAs:
   __label__iprights __label__consumers;  Each of these provisions, which are elaborated upon below, appear in DR–CAFTA and threaten to hamper generic competition—the only reliable mechanism for ensuring lower drug prices—and therefore restrict access to affordable medicines in the Central American region.4
   __label__iprights __label__consumers;  We urge members of this Committee in the strongest possible terms to take every necessary measure to ensure that the health and lives of millions of people in the Central American region are not jeopardized because of DR–CAFTA.
   __label__nonrel;  Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is an international independent medical humanitarian organization that delivers emergency aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics, natural and man-made disasters, and exclusion from health care in more than 70 countries. Through longer-term programs, MSF treats patients with infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other neglected diseases, and provides medical and psychological care to marginalized groups such as street children. The organization was awarded the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize. MSF currently has field operations in two of the countries affected by DR–CAFTA—Guatemala and Honduras.
   __label__nonrel;  In Guatemala, MSF provides antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for more than 1,600 people with HIV/AIDS in Guatemala City, Coatepeque, and Puerto Barrios, as well as psychological support and medical care for street children in Guatemala City. In Honduras, MSF is providing ARV treatment for approximately 300 people with HIV/ AIDS in Tela, as well as care for street children and victims of urban violence in Tegucigalpa.
   __label__iprights;  There are many troubling IP provisions in DR–CAFTA, but of particular concern is the U.S. Administration's attempt to push countries to accept new obstacles related to pharmaceutical test data (so called "data exclusivity"), which will delay the availability of generic medicines.
   __label__nonrel;  Under extreme pressure from the U.S. Administration, Guatemala went back and forth from 2003 to 2005 between proposed legislation that guarantees multinational pharmaceutical companies monopoly-like exclusivity on the Guatemalan market and amendments that would have maintained some degree of public health protection. 2Paragraph 4 of the Declaration states "We agree that the TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent members from taking measures to protect public health. Accordingly, while reiterating our commitment to the TRIPS Agreement, we affirm that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members' right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all."
    __label__enforcement __label__iprights;  4It is important to note that USTR "side letters" about DR–CAFTA and public health—which are not legally enforceable and do not supercede the (contradictory) language in DR–CAFTAmake dangerous attempts to restrict the scope of diseases and cannot be seen as providing any assurance for countries to make use of TRIPS safeguards.
 __label__process;  In March 2005, despite strong opposition from civil society groups in Guatemala, the Guatemalan Congress eventually passed an amendment that provides at minimum of five years of data exclusivity and cleared the way for ratification of DR–CAFTA.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  MSF is concerned that the new law, which is considered a first step in the implementation of DR–CAFTA in Guatemala, will prevent the Department of Regulation and Control of Pharmaceutical Products from granting marketing approval to generic medicines in Guatemala for five to 10 years,5 thereby giving a market monopoly to originator drug manufacturers and preventing access to affordable medicines for five to 10 years in the country (see below for a more lengthy explanation of data exclusivity).
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  In a worst case scenario, the new legislation will prevent generic medicines from entering the Guatemalan market during the period of exclusivity even if the originator medicine is not marketed in Guatemala. This means that patients may have no access at all to some medicines for five years—even exorbitantly priced originator versions. While this provision is, for the moment, only in place in Guatemala, DRCAFTA would force all parties to the agreement to implement similar laws at the national level.
    __label__nonrel;  According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS, more than 78,000 Guatemalans are currently living with HIV/AIDS, and annual AIDS-related deaths totaled 5,800 in 2003. Approximately 13,500 of all those living with HIV/ AIDS now are in urgent need of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. Yet only 3,600 Guatemalans were receiving it as of December 2004.
    __label__nonrel;  MSF has been providing ARVs to Guatemalans since 2001 and is currently treating more than 1,600 people living with HIV/AIDS in hospitals and clinics in Guatemala City, Coatepeque, and Puerto Barrios. Our clinical outcomes parallel those found in the U.S. and other industrialized countries.
    __label__nonrel;  Most of the patients in MSF's treatment programs are receiving generic medicines, which allows MSF to treat the largest possible number of people. MSF currently pays as little as $350 per person per year for the most commonly prescribed World Health Organization-recommended first-line regimens. Generic competition on the Guatemalan market has brought down the prices of originator ARVs, and the Guatemalan government is slowly moving from purchasing only originator ARVs to including generic suppliers in the national tender.
    __label__nonrel;  Still, Guatemala's social security system has spent significantly more on ARVsin some cases more than 20 times more than MSF—because it has procured mostly originator drugs. For example, whereas MSF pays $216 per person per year for a generic version of the "back-bone" double combination of AZT+3TC, Guatemala's social security system paid $4,818 (open tender 2004) for the same combination from the originator, GlaxoSmithKline. This is 22 times more than what MSF pays.
    __label__nonrel;  Guatemala has the opportunity to expand access to ARV treatment significantly, particularly because of a $40 million grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In fact, there is no reason that Guatemalan authorities should not be able to ensure universal access to ARV treatment. But if the government is paying 20 times more—or even two times more—for ARVs, only a small fraction of those in need will be treated. Treating fewer people means condemning others to premature death.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  If current data exclusivity provisions had been in effect prior to 2001, generic ARVs would not have been marketed in Guatemala and MSF would not have been able to access generics. This would have limited our ability to expand access to treatment and demonstrate the feasibility of delivering ARV treatment. In order for the Guatemalan government to expand access to ARV treatment for all those in need, it will need to retain the right to procure affordable generic AIDS medicines.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  In November 2004, the Congress of Guatemala repealed Decree 9-2003, which provided for five-year data exclusivity. In December, the Congress replaced Decree 9-2003 with Decree 34-2004, which passed by an important majority. This was seen by Guatemalan civil society groups, MSF, and others as a positive step forward, and a critical moment for the government to commit to ensuring treatment for greater numbers of people with HIV/AIDS in Guatemala. (As explained above, data exclusivity was again enacted in Guatemala in March 2005.) In the roughly 18 months
   __label__iprights __label__consumers;  5 Because the originator has five years of data exclusivity from the first date of approval in another country, and then receives another five years of protection from the date of approval in Guatemala, for a total of up to 10 years. during which Decree 9-2003 was in effect in Guatemala, 25 medicines received "data exclusivity" protection under the law. Among those medicines affected is the ARV atazananir. Atazanavir is a protease inhibitor, which is a key part of second-line therapy for people with HIV/AIDS once they experience treatment failure on their first-line regimen, and is used widely, in the U.S., Europe, and Brazil.
   __label__iprights __label__consumers;  Today, the U.S. price of atazanavir is more than US$10,000 per person per year—there is no differential price for developing countries and it must be combined with at least two additional ARVs. There is no generic version of atazanavir available on the world market because it is a relatively new drug, but based on experience with other ARVs, it is possible that the price could drop by approximately 95% with robust generic competition.6
   __label__iprights __label__consumers;  If a more affordable generic version of atazanavir is developed, however, it will not be able to enter the Guatemalan market until 2009 (given that the original atazanavir of Bristol-Myers Squibb was registered in Guatemala in February 2004). This means that BMS will have a monopoly during the entire period of exclusivity (at least five years) and, free from competition, will be able to charge whatever the market will bear—far more than what the average Guatemalan will be able to afford. It is therefore unlikely that the vast majority of Guatemalans who will need this medicine will be able to access it.
   __label__iprights __label__consumers;  This is just one example of what could happen to all new medicines entering the Guatemalan market—not only AIDS drugs—now that a U.S.-style data exclusivity law has been implemented. If DR–CAFTA is fully enacted in all countries, similar problems will be encountered in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Dominican Republic. Newer medicines will be crucial to the longer-term survival of people with HIV/AIDS and other illnesses.
 __label__iprights;  Brief analysis of IP provisions in DR–CAFTA & implications for access to medicines
   __label__iprights;  Even when a drug is not under patent, "data exclusivity" will create a new patent-like monopoly by blocking the registration of generic medicines. Data exclusivity prevents a national drug regulatory authority from using data provided by an originator company to authorize the use of an equivalent generic version of the same drug, thereby providing a de facto monopoly for the original manufacturer.
   __label__iprights;  At present: To register a medicine with a national drug regulatory authority (NDRA), an applicant has to show that its medicine is safe, effective and of quality. It is the first applicant who must show clinical trial data to prove the drug's safety and efficacy.
   __label__iprights;  When generic manufacturers seek registration (or "marketing approval") of generic versions of medicines, they only have to show that the drugs are of quality and therapeutically equivalent to the original version—in other words, they function the same way as the original medicine. The generic company does not have to submit new safety and efficacy data.
   __label__iprights;  The NDRA can rely on the safety and efficacy data submitted by the originator producer to register the generic medicine. Under these conditions, the introduction of generics to the market is accelerated and facilitated.
   __label__iprights;  In DR–CAFTA: Provisions in DR–CAFTA establish and expand "exclusive rights" over pharmaceutical test data provided by originator companies to prevent an NDRA from using that data to register a therapeutically equivalent generic version of the drug. The exclusivity would last for at least five years from the time the originator drug is first registered in the country. During this period, if another company wants to register a generic version of the drug, it would have to generate and submit its own test data.
   __label__iprights;  Further, provisions in DR–CAFTA provide for what could be described as "data exclusivity-plus": if the original manufacturer has not registered the drug in the country, then the data exclusivity period would start running from the date of approval in the other country (ie. usually the United States).
    __label__iprights;  If accepted, "data exclusivity" provisions apply regardless of whether or not a drug is patented.
    __label__iprights;  Likely impact: These provisions will keep generic versions of originator drugs that have already been registered out of a country during the period of data exclusivity (ie. five to 10 years). The requirement for a company to generate its own test data will likely discourage generic manufacturers from seeking registration for their drugs. It may even make it impossible, especially for domestic firms in developing countries, given the costs of test data and low margins of generics production.
    __label__iprights;  The main effect of this provision will be on drugs which are not under patent, as the generic manufacturer will still be unable to use the originator's test data to obtain registration. In such an instance, data exclusivity acts as a de facto patent, preventing competition.
    __label__iprights;  This impact is heightened since the data exclusivity applies from the date of approval in the U.S. as it means that a brand-name originator drug does not even have to be registered (and thus available) in the country for generic competitors to be blocked from entry. This could lead to a complete lack of availability of essential medicines (either generic or originator versions) if originator companies decide for whatever reason not to market a drug in a given country.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  The requirement to re-test a drug already proven to be safe and effective is medically unethical, because it forces a number of patients to take part in clinical trials which are not necessary, and requires some to take placebos in order to compare outcomes with the actual drug and therefore forego a proven treatment. It will also increase the cost of the generic medicine.
    __label__iprights;  Whereas patent barriers can be overcome through compulsory licensing or government use, there is no legal "remedy" for data exclusivity. Further, data exclusivity could effectively block compulsory licenses. Even if a company is given authority to produce a generic drug under a compulsory license, it still needs to register the drug with the NDRA. Data exclusivity would prevent such registration for the period of exclusivity, and thereby prevent the use of a compulsory license during that time.
    __label__iprights;  TRIPS compatibility: Nowhere does TRIPS state that countries should provide exclusive rights to the originator of the data for a given period. Rather, TRIPS simply refers generally to the need to protect "undisclosed test or other data" from "unfair commercial use" and "disclosure" (Art. 39.3), without answering the question of how such protection should occur. The language in the TRIPS Agreement makes it clear that countries can determine what constitutes "unfair" and that there are multiple approaches that countries can take to satisfy this mandate. Indeed, during negotiations on the TRIPS Agreement, prior to 1994, negotiators rejected the option to include stronger "data exclusivity" provisions in the TRIPS Agreement, as originally proposed by the United States.
    __label__iprights __label__enforcement;  2. Abusive powers to national drug regulatory authorities (NDRAs) to enforce patents
    __label__iprights;  At present: A drug's patent status and its registration status are two separate things. In principle, two different bodies look after the two different areas of competency: patent offices assess whether a drug is innovative and novel enough to be patented, and NDRAs assess whether a drug is of quality, safe and effective enough to be used by the population they are responsible for.
    __label__iprights;  When assessing whether a generic drug should be registered, a NDRA pays no attention to whether or not a patent may be infringed, as this is simply not their job—just as it is not the job of the patent office to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of a drug. It is up to the patent owner itself to sue an infringer before a court—a practice which ensures that the validity of a patent can be publicly questioned and held up to scrutiny before it is enforced.
    __label__iprights;  In DR–CAFTA; Provisions in DR–CAFTA will prevent NDRAs from registering a generic version of a drug that is under patent. Under these conditions, registration would not be granted to a generic manufacturer before the patent expires. If a drug is not registered, it cannot be legally used in a country.
    __label__iprights;  Likely impacta: These provisions amount to an outright ban on generic versions of patented medicines, by preventing their registration if there is a patent in force. The NDRA becomes the enforcer of a company's private patent rights. This is of considerable advantage to the patent holder. Rather than the company having to sue through the courts to enforce its patent, the job is done behind the scenes and without publicity by the NDRA.
    __label__iprights __label__enforcement;  It is also more likely that patents that have been awarded improperly will be wrongfully enforced. The NDRA will be obliged to enforce a patent monopoly, even though it does not have the power of a court to judge whether a patent has been properly awarded or not.'
    __label__iprights;  Further, the linking of patent status and drug registration could undermine the possible use of compulsory licences. A company given authority to produce a generic drug under compulsory licence (ie. without the patent holder's consent) still needs to register that drug with the NDRA. But if the NDRA is not allowed to register generics until the patent expires, the compulsory licence is effectively useless.
    __label__iprights;  TRIPS compatibility: Nowhere in the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (or TRIPS Agreement) is there any reference to an obligation to link patent protection and drug registration. On the contrary, the Preamble recognises that intellectual property rights are "private rights"—meaning that it is up to patent holders to enforce their rights, not NDRAs.
    __label__iprights;  There is no more straight-forward way to extend a company's monopoly over a drug than to extend the life of the drug's patent—but the impact on patients' access to that drug could be dire.
    __label__nonrel;  At present: Patents on drugs in most countries last for 20 years from the date of filing. The originator company usually applies for a patent at the stage of basic research, well before the company even applies for drug registration. The process of drug registration usually takes two-three years. The process of patent granting can also take two-three years.
    __label__iprights;  In DR–CAFTA: Provisions in DR–CAFTA seek to "compensate" drug companies for any "unreasonable" time a national drug regulatory authority takes to examine an application for registration, or a patent office takes to examine a patent application. The life of the patent would be extended by the length of "unreasonable" time the authority takes to approve the respective applications.
    __label__iprights;  Likely impact: The extra years added to the patent are extra years in which the patent holder can maintain a monopoly position and continue to charge artificially high prices for the drug, free from generic competition. There would be considerable questions over what is considered "reasonable", especially given the resource constraints on NDRAs and patent offices in developing countries.
    __label__iprights;  TRIPS compatibility: Nowhere in the TRIPS Agreement is any reference made to an obligation to extend patent life to "compensate" for "unreasonable" delays in granting registration or patent approval. Indeed, countries rejected such proposals when originally negotiating the TRIPS Agreement.
    __label__outro;  Over three years ago, 142 countries, including the U.S., negotiated and adopted the Doha Declaration, firmly placing public health needs above commercial interests and offering much needed clarifications about key flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement related to public health. Today, these flexibilities are being threatened by bilateral and regional trade agreements such as DR–CAFTA.
    __label__outro;  The WTO TRIPS Agreement already establishes more than sufficient standards for 1P protection in WTO member states. The promise of Doha is that the TRIPS Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner "supportive of WTO members' right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all." 8 DR–CAFTA threatens to make it impossible for the concerned countries to exercise the rights reaffirmed in Doha.
    __label__outro __label__iprights __label__consumers;  If DR–CAFTA is fully enacted, IP provisions may block the use of affordable generic medicines, which will be a catastrophe for our patients and millions of others in the region with HIV/AIDS and other diseases.
    __label__outro;  As a medical humanitarian organization, we cannot accept the subordination of the health needs of our patients and millions of others to U.S. trade interests.
    __label__intro;  The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Party (FMLN) of El Salvador, Central America, as the majority party in Congress, we write to you respectfully at this time to inform you about our position on the ratification of the Free Trade Agreement between El Salvador and the United States (DR–CAFTA).
    __label__intro;  Free trade agreements contain many aspects that go beyond import-export issues to include a wide variety of topics such as investment, intellectual property rights, governmental purchases, services, competition policies, telecommunications, and the financial sector, worker rights, environmental issues among others.
    __label__intro;  For small countries who subscribe to them, these agreements end up defining the framework for public policies. Regulations established in the chapters on intellectual property rights and investments, government purchases, and trade in services, which infringe on the sovereign jurisdiction of the State, by promoting the privatization of public services through concessions. If States are unable to define national economic policy and control strategic services, they will face serious limitations in their ability to assure the economic, social, and cultural rights of the great majority of the population of which 80% of households are in different levels of poverty.
    __label__intro;  With the ratification of these agreements by our countries' legislative branches, the agreements become the law of the land. El Salvador is then faced with an all-encompassing instrument that legalizes the privileges of transnational corporations and turns them into rights. As this occurs the basic rights of workers, women, children and elders will be lost.
    __label__position;  The FMLN rejects the mercantilist logic of the "free trade" agreements. A critical analysis of the CAFTA texts reveals the many negative impacts of the agreement, which would have on the daily life of the people and ecosystems of our countries—especially on women and impoverished families—as national sovereignty is eroded, legal frameworks are corrupted, and the neo-liberal nature of public policy is reinforced.
    __label__jobs __label__poverty __label__democratization;  Defining free trade agreements as a synonym for economic growth, job creation, environmental protection, and wellbeing of the people is nothing but demagoguery aimed at generating a favorable opinion and the acceptance of neo-liberal policies. In fact, these policies cause a greater concentration of income and the wealth into the hands of transnational corporations and the wealthiest people of our lands. At this time, only 1 out of 3 people in El Salvador are permanently salaried employees. Given the projections from the United States, DR–CAFTA will massively increase the exportation in agriculture products which implies only for El Salvador, that in the first fourteen years of the agreement we will lose 400,000 permanent jobs only in the agricultural and textile industry.1 This will further increase poverty in El Salvador and all Central America and the Dominican Republic, therefore, democracy and political stability will continue to weaken and at the same time the migration will augment profusely from El Salvador and Central America. This has been proven with Nafta.
    __label__position;  The following is a summary of the principle reasons why we reject DR–CAFTA and why we ask the representatives of the United States Congress to do the same.
 __label__exports __label__fdi __label__subsidies;  1. The Mirage of Free Trade. Free trade is not possible within a context where a country like the United States relies on subsidized and protectionist measures for its own economy (especially to protect against imported agricultural products) while at the same time forcing other countries to open their economies indiscriminately to U.S. exports and capital.
 __label__nonrel;  2. Unrecognized Asymmetries. There is an unwillingness to recognize the asymmetries that exist in our economies and businesses—especially micro, small, and medium-sized businesses—that operate at low levels of efficiency and are unable to compete. These asymmetries exist because of the lack of an effective policy of incentives, innovations, training, and access to financial services. They are heightened by deteriorating infrastructure and by constant and
 __label__immigration;  3. Impediments to Migration. DR—CAFTA facilitates only the movement of "business people" who work in large corporations, yet it does not incorporate or recognize the fundamental labor rights in El Salvador and Central America. This is a direct violation of the Salvador Constitution.
 __label__development;  4. Weakening of the State's Social Obligations. The State is increasingly abandoning its obligation to assure the economic and social wellbeing of all of its inhabitants, favoring instead the interests of transnational corporations and foreign investment in new laws on tariffs, competition, labor rights, environment, quality of services and taxes, among others.
 __label__process;  5. Exclusionary and Anti-democratic Negotiations. Negotiations for these agreements are carried out in quasi-secret conditions, outside the control of citizens. The ratification of DR—CAFTA in El Salvador was done without the consensus of the Salvadoran people. Refusal to contemplate a serious debate within Congress lead to the lack of substantial research and evaluation on DR—CAFTA and it's effect on the political, social, and economic impact in the country. Sectors that represent micro, small, and medium-sized businesses have been excluded from trade negotiations, as have workers, consumers, professionals, and other representatives of civil society. In the case of the uprising in Guatemala the population opposed openly DR—CAFTA and the response of the government was a repressive answer which concluded in violence. The similarity in the approval of DR—CAFTA in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador goes to show the anti democratic process to impose DR—CAFTA in Central America.
 __label__process;  6. No Assessment of Real Impact. None of the Central American countries has undertaken studies to evaluate the economic, social, environmental, and cultural impacts of CAFTA, to forecast the net balance in terms of jobs created and lost in the various sectors of the economy, or to measure the environmental, social, and cultural impacts of new investments.
 __label__development;  7. The Privatization of Public Goods and Services. This agreement creates ideal conditions for transnational corporations to become the owners of the remaining public enterprises and opens the door for services like water, security, health, education, museums, parks, highways, ports, and airports to become private monopolies or oligopolies.
 __label__jobs __label__laborrights;  8. The Consolidation of the Maquila Development Model. Maquilas generate miserable and unjust conditions of employment, especially for young women, and corporations that take advantage of permissive legislation to abuse the rights of workers. Within the maquila model, the ability to compete depends on cheap labor and the use of contaminating and extractive technologies that help to lower production costs even further. So, even this sector has not adequately incorporated in DR—CAFTA the protection of Maquilas permanent future within the countries of Central America. The projections of the CBI countries will lose a market equivalent of 6.3 billion dollars with a massive loss of employment that only for El Salvador will imply 60,000 losses of permanent jobs. This is the result of the open market of the textile and garment industry from China.
 __label__iprights;  9. The Legalization of Bio-piracy and the Looting of Natural Resources. A permissive framework is established for transnational companies that work in biogenetics, biotechnology, the food industry, or chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Doors are further opened for our people to be victimized once again by the extraction of their natural resources, which now include plant species, micro-organisms, and traditional knowledge that could be "patented" by transnational corporations.
 __label__econsecurity;  10. A Coup de Grace to Agriculture and a Threat to Food Security. The elimination of tariffs as well as the invasion of agricultural goods subsidized in the United States will bankrupt local producers and cause irreversible damage to our capacity to produce our own food. The region will then become simply a market that trades basic goods for commercial reasons, even as the quality of the imported food (genetically modified) may seriously threaten the health of consumers.
 __label__process;  11. A Violation of the Constitution. Constitutionally established jurisdictions of the executive, legislative and judicial branches are being undermined in order to pass laws and policies compatible with DR—CAFTA. National territory is also undermined, as sovereignty up to 200 miles from shore would not be recognized. The Legislative Assembly has also been forced to ratify the agreements without the due deliberation required of this body. Finally, cor-
 __label__consumers;  12. Lack of access to Generic Medicine. There is a duplicitous conflict which results in the protection of the interest of the large biochemical corporations and the denial and lack of healthcare of the population in El Salvador and Central America.
    __label__position;  For these reasons, we oppose the passage of the Dominican Republic—Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR–CAFTA), and manifest the following:
    __label__nonrel;  First: We call on the Salvadoran population and the people of Central America to increase their struggle against the governments' willingness to turn the country over to powerful corporations. We call on them to strengthen the articulation of their organizing efforts and to present alternative proposals elaborated by civil society, with the participation of actors from various territories and sectors, in order to promote a true process of social integration among our peoples.
    __label__nonrel;  Second: We propose the participatory construction of an alternative Central American integration plan (including Belize and Panama) that would promote unity; improve the quality of life of our peoples; guarantee full respect for human rights; guarantee sustainability in harmony with the ecosystem and with our multicultural, multi-lingual societies; and strengthen the sovereignty of our country. We stand firmly in favor of the integration of Central America with all of the peoples of the Caribbean and Latin America which DR–CAFTA denies.
    __label__nonrel;  Third: We invite social and labor organizations of the United States—where more than two million of our brothers and sisters reside—to work with us to create an agreement an agreement for development which includes technical cooperation and a positive social and economic integration with the United States that emphasizes full respect for human rights; the free migration of persons; socio-environmental sustainability; fair trade; investments that transfer clean technologies and production processes; the cancellation of the foreign debt; and the payment of the ecological debt, in order to achieve a democratic, sustainable, and just society in Central America.
    __label__nonrel;  Fourth: We ask all legislators to vote NO on DR–CAFTA and to work instead for the rights and interests of all people and for a regional integration that is just, sustainable, and mutually supportive.
    __label__nonrel;  Fifth: In El Salvador DR–CAFTA was approved without any respect for our judicial process which violates our constitution. DR–CAFTA clearly violates the countries constitution and we have presented a law suit to the Supreme Court in El Salvador to declare DR–CAFTA unconstitutional. Congress Representatives were not allowed to debate the contents of DR–CAFTA and the President of the National Congress declared "although he wasn't knowledgeable about DR–CAFTA he was going to allow approval of DR–CAFTA".
    __label__intro __label__position;  Fair trade agreements are possible, and if accompanied with aid and investment, can play n important role in promoting development within the context of a more just society. Based on the following analysis the final CAFTA text, we join with American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) in concluding that, on balance, the CAFTA agreement does not serve the interests of justice and the common good.
   __label__intro;  This document measures the proposed Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA)1 against the principles that are central to the Interfaith Statement on International Trade and Investment by the Interfaith Working Group in Trade and
    __label__intro;  AFSC and other organizations in the IWG have worked for many decades in Central America and in the U.S. on issues that concern this region. Our work has been that of witness and listening to those with whom we work, providing them with the opportunity to speak to a wider audience and being present on their behalf when they cannot. In this work, we regularly provide information and analysis of complex economic justice issues and advocate with our partners for just economic policies.
    __label__poverty;  Given the failure of World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial talks in Seattle (1999) and Cancun (2003) to come to agreement, the U.S. government is now actively pursuing regional and bilateral trade agreements modeled on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). After ten years, the accumulated evidence surrounding the NAFTA demonstrates that many dire predictions made by its opponents were not borne out. But on the other hand, it was clearly not the panacea some thought it would be. A growing number of experts are questioning whether the NAFTA model is the best template for future trade and investment agreements as many negative impacts are uncovered—most severely felt by small farmers and the poor. Since the CAFTA extends the harmful aspects of NAFTA rather than correcting them, the chances for fair, sustainable development in the region will be diminished.
    __label__nonrel;  Even in the face of the emerging criticism of this model, U.S. policy has been to attempt to expand NAFTA to all 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere, excluding Cuba, in the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) agreement. But their efforts have met severe resistance. Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Bolivia are unwilling to accept the U.S. demand for a comprehensive FTAA agreement like NAFTA, and have instead been negotiating for a more flexible model that allows countries to opt in or out of different parts of the agreement. Not at all pleased with this strategy, the U.S. is now focused on passing the CAFTA in hopes of isolating Brazil and pressuring them to change their tactics.
    __label__process;  The CAFTA text was released to the public for the first time on January 28, 2004, two years after the start of negotiations. Although CAFTA has been ready to go to Congress since President Bush signed the agreement on May 28, 2004, supporters have held back due to a lack of votes needed to get it passed.
    __label__process;  Thanks to "Fast Track", Congress can only vote yes or no without amending the trade agreement. If CAFTA passes Congress in its current form, it will harm the most vulnerable in Central America, will be more comprehensive and intrusive upon national sovereignty than the NAFTA agreement, and if ratified, will become the model for future U.S. regional trade agreements.
    __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__humanrights;  1) International trade and investment systems should respect and support the dignity of the human person, the integrity of creation, and our common humanity.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  Also a threat to common humanity, CAFTA's Intellectual Property Rights rules in Chapter 15 would grant exclusivity on medical test data to pharmaceutical companies for five years. This would have the effect of establishing a five-year patent monopoly and a ban on generic production of certain medicines.6 This would be the case even if the patent term have expired and even if countries have issued compulsory licenses that would otherwise allow them to produce and sell generics while a product is patented—making it difficult for Central American governments to obtain cheaper drugs to meet their public health needs.
    __label__development __label__jobs __label__poverty;  The final CAFTA agreement is closely modeled after the NAFTA and will have similar impacts on the poor and vulnerable. Although the agreement helped provide employment opportunities and improved standards of living for some, NAFTA has not fully measured up to the principle of advancing the common good. Nobel Laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz has described NAFTA's impact on Mexico since the agreement passed ten years ago: poor Mexican farmers have faced an uphill battle in their effort to compete with highly subsidized American corn, local small-sized enterprises have lost access to credit from foreign-owned banks, growth has slowed, income disparities between the U.S. and Mexico grew and real wages have fallen.7 In an analysis of the CAFTA text by Oxfam International,8 they found that many Central American producers of basic grains, such as corn, rice, beans and sorghum, as well as poultry, pig, cow and dairy farmers, will be forced out of business by the flood of cheap subsidized goods coming from the U.S. The only products that will continue to receive protection under CAFTA are white corn in Central America, fresh onions and potatoes in Costa Rica, and sugar in the U.S. Because of the importation of highly subsidized U.S. yellow corn, prices in the region will likely suffer a dramatic drop, seriously affecting producers. As happened in Mexico, subsistence and small farmers will migrate off their lands to the already overcrowded urban centers experiencing high levels of unemployment.
    __label__process;  The negotiating text of CAFTA was never available to civil society until the negotiations were completed. Without creating negotiating mechanisms that include the participation of all who are affected, we cannot expect the outcomes to benefit them. In the U.S., Congress approved Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) also known as `fast track'. This legislation gives the executive branch the power to negotiate trade agreements and leaves Congress with two options: vote yes or no. As a result, Congress cannot respond to constituents and influence or amend the agreement.
   __label__laborrights;  'The ILO core labor standards include the rights to freedom of association, collective bargaining, the elimination of forced labor, the abolition of child labor, and the elimination of discrimination.
    __label__govprocure;  The CAFTA would prevent government procurement processes that give preferences to local firms in granting contracts—making criteria other than price and quality 'unnecessary barriers to trade'. This means that the use of government contracts to promote gender equity, social justice and respect for human rights would be prohibited. For example, living wage legislation, which mandates that a municipality can only hire suppliers that pay their employees a living wage—higher than minimum wage and determined locally—would be undermined. Although the U.S. negotiated an exception for procurement policies on behalf of its own small and minority businesses—and Costa Rica and Nicaragua did the same for small, medium and micro enterprises—El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras filed no such exceptions.9
    __label__fdi;  The U.S. pushed for an investment agreement in the CAFTA that prohibits performance requirements intended to influence the behavior of foreign investors. As a result, governments cannot mandate that a foreign company buy a certain percentage of its inputs from a domestic producer or hire a certain percentage of local people. Historically, this was a common tool used by now developed countries to spur the growth of local industries.
    __label__iprights __label__environment;  The CAFTA rules in Chapter 15 on Intellectual Property Rights could be used to weaken national or international health and environmental standards. According to an analysis of the text done by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy10 CAFTA would require Central American countries to adopt the U.S. model of corporate patenting rights including ratification of the Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) of 1991.11 The UPOV allows for patents on plants that trump farmers' traditional rights to save their own seeds. This would essentially permit multinational biotech corporations to sue farmers for patent violations, even when using their own seeds if crops become contaminated by pollen drift or distribution systems.
    __label__outro;  Guided by the principles of the Interfaith Statement on International Trade and Investment, fair trade in the Western Hemisphere is an achievable goal. With these principles incorporated into trade agreements, they could foster a more just, sustainable, and prosperous human society. In its current form, the CAFTA does not measure up to the principles articulated by the Interfaith Working Group on Trade and Investment (IWG) and adopted by the board of AFSC in 2001. For this reason, the IWG and AFSC take a stance against the CAFTA agreement in its current form.
    __label__intro __label__position __label__laborrights;  The International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF) would like to thank the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives for the opportunity to present testimony related to the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). ILRF is deeply concerned about ongoing labor rights violations in Central America. We believe the agreement will force the developing nations of Central America to compete against one another to attract limited new U.S. investment by offering low wages and foregoing enforcement of labor and environmental laws.
    __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  A strong and enforceable labor chapter might have served to mitigate this "race to the bottom." However, as currently written, the CAFTA labor chapter will not serve to deter labor rights abuses, nor will it effectively deter national governments from downgrading their existing labor laws. Thus, as currently written, CAFTA can only lead to further degeneration of the labor rights situation in Central America, with no effective mechanism available to counteract downward pressures.
    __label__laborrights;  Although the CAFTA labor chapter refers to the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the agreement does not bind any of its Parties to ensuring that internationally recognized worker rights are incorporated into national laws, or that they are properly enforced. The language of the agreement is merely aspirational, directing parties to strive to improve their laws, but providing no effective reward or sanction for countries in this regard. Indeed there is no language in the agreement that would prevent or sanction countries from reforming their laws in such a manner as to abrogate the internationally recognized worker rights.
    __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  The agreement is thus a step backward from the earlier trade arrangements with each country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. While imperfect, at least the GSP program does require beneficiaries to be able to demonstrate that they are taking steps to ensure that workers enjoy the internationally recognized rights to associate and bargain collectively, to abolish child labor, to abolish forced labor and to provide the right to decent wages and working conditions. In contrast, CAFTA merely requires countries to be enforcing their existing laws, however inadequate those laws may be.
    __label__enforcement __label__laborrights;  Given the history of the Central America region, we find it disingenous to suggest that these countries can be entrusted with enforcement of their own labor laws. ILRF and its partners throughout the region have conducted extensive research on labor law implementation in Central America, dating back to the late 1980s. During the past two decades ILRF has used this research to support GSP petitions related to Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala. ILRF and its partners conducted new research on labor law enforcement in the region in 2003 and 2004, and found evidence of systematic failures to enforce labor laws in all Central American countries. The systematic problems identified included a lack of political will at the highest levels, corrupt and inefficient labor ministries and courts, and intimidation and harassment of workers who attempted to utilize legal channels to protect their rights. The language of the CAFTA labor chapter, which, as we have mentioned, is largely aspirational, ignores the realities of legal enforcement in these countries.
    __label__enforcement __label__laborrights;  The single enforceable provision of the chapter, on labor law enforcement, does not give us reason to believe that governments will improve in this regard. The process for invoking a review of a country's compliance is too weak, opaque and limited to create real change in labor law enforcement. The CAFTA labor chapter effectively sets the fox to guard the henhouse, by creating a review process that can only
    __label__mobilization;  Civil society actors, in particular workers and their representative organizations have no means by which to affect this process. The process can only be triggered by a national government, and there is no mechanism created by which a civil society organization can petition its government to initiate such a review. Moreover, the agreement does not even provide the general public with information about the outcome of a review, should one ever take place. Thus there is no way that the general public in any of the CAFTA countries can ever know whether or not the review process, if ever invoked, actually resulted in any meaningful dialogue on the issues identified.
    __label__transparency __label__laborrights;  In contrast, the existing GSP provides for a public review process. Any individual or organization can utilize this process, which is comparatively transparent and accessible, by filing a submission to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Throughout the past two decades a handful of organizations, including ILRF, the AFL—CIO, and Human Rights Watch have researched and filed lengthy petitions documenting labor rights abuses in GSP recipient countries. Although not all of these cases were successful, nevertheless, the cases obliged both the U.S. Administration and regimes in the targeted countries to respond, point by point, to allegations of abuse. In Malaysia in 1991, an ILRF petition succeeded in convincing the Malaysian government to recognize union rights in the electronics sector. A 1996 AFL—CIO petition on Thailand succeeded in pushing the Thai government to recognize the right of state enterprise workers to form trade unions. A 1997 petition against Cambodia, filed separately by both the AFL—CIO and ILRF, persuaded the Cambodian government to ratify a new Labor Code. This process, while admittedly limited in effectiveness, is at least superior to the CAFTA process in its relative public accessibility and transparency. The fact that the existing GSP process will be replaced by the weaker CAFTA review mechanism will create further disincentives for the CAFTA governments regarding improvement of their labor laws and labor law implementation.
    __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  While the CAFTA labor chapter references the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, it fails to include any obligation of governments, even aspirational, with regard to the right to a workplace free from discrimination. This right is universally recognized as a core labor right and defined in ILO Conventions No. 100 and 111. We note that a large percentage of the workers expected to find employment in export-oriented sectors, such as the maquila industry, are women. Our research and that of our allies has found that these women workers are subject to discrimination through, among other problems, pregnancy testing as a precondition for employment, sexual harassment on the job, and non-provision of maternity leave benefits. In most instances they have limited legal recourse, and often are subject to social and economic pressures that make it in reality impossible to claim what legal protections they may have on paper.
    __label__nonrel;  We urge Congress to insist that CAFTA and any future trade agreements reference the essential right to a workplace free from discrimination. Such a clause would help bring the attention of developing countries throughout the world to the plight and problems of vulnerable women workers.
    __label__nonrel;  In December 2004, ILRF and ASEPROLA, a Costa Rican labor rights NGO, co-filed GSP petitions against five Central American countries. We found that, despite the U.S. Trade Representative's public claims to the contrary, even during the period of CAFTA negotiations, Central American countries, preparing for competition with one another for limited U.S. investment, were taking steps to downgrade their labor laws. USTR has not yet responded to the request for review of these countries' GSP privileges, and if CAFTA is ratified, then no such review will ever take place. We note below some instances, documented in these petitions, of legal reforms that would weaken worker protections in the region.
    __label__laborrights;  Costa Rica: During the CAFTA negotiations, the Costa Rican government has taken steps to weaken existing national labor protections. In early 2004 the govern-
    __label__laborrights;  El Salvador: The emergency law for economic reactivation (LERE), which was introduced to the Assembly in 1999, has continued during the period of CAFTA negotiations to work its way through the legislative process in El Salvador. If approved, LERE would modify salaries and working shifts, and increase the allowed length of a trial period for new workers and the use of fixed-term contracts. These changes affect benefits currently guaranteed by labor law, including vacations and social security. The current Labor Code includes indefinite contracts and a 30-day test period (during which time the contract can be terminated). LERE would make fixed-term contracts and 180-day test periods the norm, which means that the social security payments for these workers are not made for almost 6 months. This drastically increases job instability, making it easier for employers to make workers work overtime without extra pay, and to dismiss workers without paying penalties or benefits. El Salvador is also considering new legislative measures that would weaken existing health and safety regulations.
    __label__laborrights;  Panama: There is some evidence that Panama has continued to weaken its labor law regime during the past two years when it has been involved with trade negotiations with the U.S. (While not a CAFTA country, Panama has been negotiating a separate bilateral agreement with the U.S., with discussions regarding the possibility that Panama would 'dock on' to CAFTA). In February 2002, a new regulation was passed that provides incentives to companies to hire "young workers" between the ages of 18 and 25. The incentives include temporary exoneration from certain legal protections for these workers. In particular, the regulations suspend the protections of certain articles of the Labor Code for such workers, in particular the protections for maternity benefits. Other reforms are in progress, although they have not yet been presented to the Panamanian parliament. These include an initiative to modify the Labor Code to eliminate minimum wages altogether, and a proposal to reform the country's social security benefits to increase the retirement age, quotas, and years of contribution to the system. The proposed social security reforms are expected to be presented to the Panamanian parliament in early 2005.
    __label__laborrights;  Honduras: In its petition, ILRF and ASEPROLA noted that the USTR has failed to implement the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding negotiated with the Honduran government as a result of a 1995 GSP complaint. The MOU, if implemented would have resulted in important changes to Honduran labor law and its labor inspections system. Rather, the CAFTA negotiations have tacitly discouraged the Honduran government from implementing those commitments and created perverse incentives for labor law reform. Currently, the Honduran Ministry of Labor, working with employers' groups, is promoting a project to modify the labor law with reforms that would generalize fixed-term contracts. It would also make the payment for severance payable only on an annual basis so that it would not be possible to create special funds with these monies. A policy of freezing salaries continues, and Honduran employers are increasingly delaying negotiations with workers.
    __label__laborrights;  Guatemala: In 2003, USTR accepted for review GSP petitions filed by ILRF and by the AFL—CIO to review Guatemala's country eligibility based on its failure to uphold internationally recognized worker rights. These petitions cited the judicial impunity with regard to threats and violence against trade unionists in Guatemala, the systematic failure of the government to enforce existing labor laws, and the need for further reforms to the country's labor laws in order to bring it into full compliance with international standards. The new ILRF/ASEPROLA petition states that the review has failed to bring about meaningful progress in these three areas. The labor code reforms passed in 2001 did not bring Guatemala's labor practices up to acceptable standards, and some of these reforms have been reversed by Guatemala's Constitutional Courts. A number of promised legislative reforms have never materialized.
    __label__nonrel;  ILRF strongly urges that any new trade agreement with Central America contain a strong, transparent and enforceable labor rights mechanism. Sustained economic development will elude a vast majority of the populations of the Central American countries without such a mechanism.
    __label__nonrel;  The key elements of a workable enforcement mechanism to apply upon the failure of a national enforcement system can be easily stated. First and foremost, any enforcement process must be democratic and transparent. A major criticism of the WTO enforcement panels is that they are closed to the public and operate in secrecy. CAFTA replicates this secretive model. All processes involving enforcement must be fully transparent, including a written public record of all proceedings and open hearings. There also needs to be a clear appeals process.
    __label__nonrel;  Second, access to the enforcement process must be available to all interested parties, not just the government signatories to the trade agreement. The key constituency here is the workers themselves, most of whom are not currently represented by a trade union. They must have direct access to an enforcement process. Also, other stakeholders, such as NGOs and labor organisations, must have access to the process.
    __label__nonrel;  Third, the enforcement process must make a distinction between violations that are attributable to private actors, including multinationals, and therefore require remedies more in the line of penalties, and those that are attributable to governments, and might be better addressed by trade sanctions. Penalties directed at companies, with the cooperation of the host government, will resolve most problems. This also leaves problem solving within the firm control of the individual governments and allows them to act to prevent any protectionist use of the enforcement process. If a country ultimately refuses to enforce its own laws, as per the commitment made in its own laws and the international standards, there must be a system of penalties to encourage compliance, with the ultimate sanction being exclusion from the benefits of the trade agreement.
    __label__outro;  Finally, in keeping with the ILO standards, a model labor clause in CAFTA or any other trade agreement must include language recognizing the right of workers to a workplace free from discrimination, as defined by ILO Conventions No. 100 and 111.
    __label__intro;  Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, I am Mark Berlind, Executive Vice President, Global Corporate Affairs, Kraft Foods, Inc. Thank you for allowing me to submit this statement on the U.S.-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA—DR). Trade is an issue of vital importance to Kraft, our 50,000 U.S.-based employees, our stakeholders, other U.S. food manufacturers, and thousands of American farmers who supply high quality raw materials to the U.S. food processing industry.
    __label__intro;  Kraft Foods, which recently celebrated its one hundredth anniversary, traces its origin back to the days when James L. Kraft rented a horse and wagon and started selling cheese in Chicago. The company he founded and built is now the largest branded food company in the U.S. and the second largest in the world. Last year, Kraft reported net revenues of over $32 billion from sales in 155 countries.
    __label__intro;  The Chicago area is still our home, and America remains our biggest market. Kraft products can be found in 99% of American households. In addition to our flagship cheese brands, we take pride in producing and marketing many other iconic food and beverage brands, including Ritz crackers, Post cereals, Maxwell House coffee, DiGiorno pizza, Oreo cookies, Planters nuts, and Oscar Mayer meat products.
    __label__intro;  Kraft is essentially in the business of transforming raw or semi-processed farm commodities into consumer-ready products. On a global basis, Kraft buys $7 billion worth of agricultural commodities annually. We are one of the world's largest buyers of dairy products, sugar, meats, coffee, oils, and nuts. We also purchase large quantities of wheat, rice, corn, and soy and other crops.
    __label__intro;  Last year, for use in our U.S. manufacturing facilities, we bought $3.6 billion worth of farm commodities. This included $1.3 billion worth of dairy products, nearly half a billion dollars worth of pork, and almost one quarter of a billion dollars worth of sugar.
    __label__intro;  We believe that the growth and success of Kraft and the strength of our brands is directly linked to the emphasis we place on providing consumers with high quality, good-tasting, convenient and fun products at the right price. This involves a constant challenge to provide better products to our customers at the best value.
    __label__exports;  The 50 U.S. states are currently Kraft's largest market. Given U.S. demographic realities, however, future growth for Kraft—as well as for the entire U.S. food and agriculture complex—is inextricably tied to our ability to access export markets. Mr. Chairman, as you and most other farm state Members know, 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside the U.S. That is where future growth will take place.
    __label__position;  Kraft and Entire U.S. Food Industry Would Benefit from Access to CAFTA–DR Markets
    __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  There are about 46 million consumers living in the six CAFTA–DR countries (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic). With moderate population growth, rising incomes, and improved diets, demand for U.S. processed foods is expanding. For U.S. food and agricultural producers, in particular, population age and growth are among important indicators of market potential. For comparison purposes, the median age of the U.S. population is 36 years, and rising. Median ages for our six prospective CAFTA–DR partners are dramatically younger, ranging from 18.4 years in Guatemala to 25.7 years in Costa Rica. And, while the U.S. population is growing at a rate of less than one percent (.92%) annually, rates for the six countries range from 1.33 percent for the Dominican Republic to 2.61 percent for Guatemala. These numbers have striking implications for projected levels of food consumption inside the U.S. vs. within the six CAFTA–DR countries over the foreseeable future.
    __label__exports;  In general, U.S. exports of processed food products already capture roughly one quarter of total food imports into the six countries, and U.S. brands—including a number of well-known Kraft brands—are popular throughout the region. Already, exports of many processed food products are growing faster than other agricultural products. We are convinced CAFTA–DR would make Kraft products even more competitive, and more popular, in the region.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__exports;  Food, beverages, and consumer products currently face an average ad valorem tariff of 15 percent in the five CAFTA countries and 20 percent in the Dominican Republic (DR). Some food products like processed cheese and cream cheese—products of special interest to Kraft—face tariffs that range up to 66 percent in some CAFTA countries. Under the Agreement, tariffs on U.S. exports of most food and beverage products would be reduced to zero over fifteen years. Certain products, such as breakfast cereals, cookies, and pet food products would receive immediate duty free treatment. This means Kraft would benefit immediately on products like our Post breakfast cereals, Oreo cookies, and Milk Bone pet foods.
    __label__exports __label__forbarriersred;  The DR is currently the largest market of the six for Kraft products. And, that market could be much larger if it were not constrained by the most daunting tariffs we face in the region. During 2004, Kraft shipped nearly 700 tons of food products, worth $1.7 million, to the DR. This included 192 tons of Kraft Mayonnaise, 65 tons of Oreos and Chips Ahoy cookies, and 62 tons of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. While the DR technically maintains a tariff of 20 percent on most food products, other added import charges lift the total effective rate to 33 percent. Consequently, it cost Kraft over a half million dollars in tariffs to enter the products we shipped to the DR in 2004. Much of this cost would be passed forward to the DR consumer. Because it is fundamental that the higher the price, the less the consumer buys, there is no question that the present 33 percent effective DR tariff retards sales of Kraft and other imported U.S. food products. Elimination of tariffs would boost sales and could encourage the introduction of new product lines.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Others have already stressed that the U.S. charges no tariffs on nearly all of the food and agriculture products received from the CAFTA–DR countries. From Kraft's perspective, CAFTA–DR would simply level the playing field, and create a more equitable trading relationship.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__exports;  A recent study by the Grocery Manufacturers of America (GMA) estimated that the potential savings to the processed food industry from the tariff reductions and tariff-rate quota expansions provided for under CAFTA–DR would be nearly $8.8 million in the first year of the Agreement. This figure grows to nearly $28 million annually upon full implementation of the Agreement. Upon elimination of tariffs, food exports could, according to this study, increase from $359 million to $662 million—an 84% increase over current exports to the region, according to the GMA study.
    __label__exports __label__growth;  During 2004, the value of shipments of Kraft consumer products from the U.S. into the six CAFTA–DR countries totaled $10.6 million Well over $2 million in tar-
   __label__forbarriersred;  One of the most important features of the Agreement for Kraft and for the entire U.S. processed food industry is its comprehensiveness. All products are included in the Agreement, including sugar, a key ingredient for Kraft and for many food and beverage manufacturers. The Agreement provides for increased access to lower-priced Central American and DR sugar, but in a very modest way that fully recognizes the sensitivity of this commodity in our country.
   __label__position;  Kraft is a strong supporter of trade liberalization and a vigorous advocate for this and most other trade agreements. We believe such agreements create opportunity and are good for our employees, our stakeholders, our industry, and our country.
   __label__nonrel;  The food industry believes that no products should be excluded from FTA's negotiated between the U.S. and other countries. We—and most of the U.S. food industry—did not support the U.S.-Australia FTA because sugar was excluded. We're convinced that—as the Australian experience proved—the exclusion of any single commodity from free trade agreements because of our import sensitivities provides our trading partners with an excuse to take their import sensitive issues off the table as well. This downward spiral in ambition jeopardizes the very benefits that our economy derives from free trade. In the case of CAFTA, we would expect that an attempt to re-negotiate sugar would, at a minimum, erode benefits for other U.S. agricultural commodities, possibly dairy and poultry, but more likely this would cause the entire delicately balanced Agreement to unravel.
   __label__position __label__exports;  As a country that enjoys the world's strongest economy, our message to other countries simply can't be that we're only interested in free trade in those goods and services for which we maintain a competitive advantage. I am here today to express Kraft's strong endorsement of this Agreement in its entirety, even though some benefits for U.S. exporters will literally take years to be realized. However, if there were to be a decision subsequent to this hearing that upsets the delicate balance that the negotiators reached in order to forge an agreement by taking specific commodities off the table—including nullification of the current sugar provisions—Kraft would have a very difficult time continuing to support this pact.
   __label__nonrel;  As I noted earlier, Kraft is a major buyer and user of sugar. Since a penny change in the U.S. per pound price of sugar means $8 million annually to Kraft, we regard ourselves as a major stakeholder in the sugar program debate. We recognize the need to preserve a viable domestic sugar industry. The current support scheme, however, essentially imposes a regressive tax on U.S. consumers of sugar-containing products. According to U.S. submissions to the WTO, the tax transfers a trade-distorting subsidy of over $1 billion annually to U.S. sugar growers. This is money that comes directly out of consumers' pockets.
   __label__process;  Kraft favors safety net assistance to agricultural producers, including sugar. There is broad agreement that CAFTA–DR, provides more protection for sugar than for any other commodity, while at the same time adhering to the principle that every commodity needs to be addressed—even if minimally—in free trade agreements. The overall compromise that the negotiators reached on these difficult issues needs to be preserved.
   __label__position;  CAFTA–DR, like all trade agreements, is fundamentally a political agreement. As all of you know, political agreements involve compromise and are rarely perfect from all perspectives. While Kraft supports this Agreement, there are elements of the pact we, too, wish were different. For example, it would take 20 years for CAFTA tariffs on cheese and other dairy goods—products of keen interest to Kraft—to reach zero. Twenty years is the longest tariff phase-out period in the entire Agreement and the longest tariff phase-out the U.S. has accepted in any trade agreement. On the import side, the increases for sugar are very small and the over-quota tariff on sugar is never eliminated—another feature of this Agreement unique to sugar. Though not perfect, we regard this as a good Agreement for us on balance, and we are determined to do all we can to advocate that it is implemented as negotiated.
   __label__alliance;  While we believe that there are adequate commercial reasons to approve this agreement, there are additional factors that should be considered in evaluating this issue. As I noted earlier, Kraft is already active in these countries. Not only do we have customers in these markets, we have employees and shareholders in the region. We are aware that business and industry leaders in these countries are eagerly looking forward to forging a new and stronger trade relationship with the U.S. Kraft believes that CAFTA—DR would strengthen our mutual competitiveness, enhance political stability and contribute to the security of the entire North American continent.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__usleadership;  Leaders of these six nations appear to be fully committed to economic development, including the dismantlement of trade barriers. If the United States is unwilling to support and partner with them, the reality is that they would find other eager partners, ceding these key and growing markets to others and further disadvantaging U.S. businesses, employees, ranchers and farmers.
    __label__usleadership;  Finally, we believe that Congress should seriously consider the effect of its decision regarding CAFTA—DR on the credibility of U.S. negotiators. Failure of Congress to approve legislation to implement CAFTA—DR would dash the credibility of our trade negotiators and cast a chill over all ongoing U.S. trade negotiations. The perception of our trading partners would be that commitments made by U.S. negotiators cannot be trusted and that the U.S. is abandoning the leadership position it has held on trade since the end of World War II.
    __label__position __label__outro;  Kraft strongly supports CAFTA—DR. We urge the Committee and the Congress to vote for legislation that would implement this critically important agreement.
    __label__intro;  Thank you for the opportunity to share my organization's views on the proposed Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). I submit my statement for the record.
    __label__intro;  With approximately 115,000 members throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) is the largest and oldest Hispanic Organization in the United States. LULAC advances the economic condition, educational attainment, political influence, health and civil rights of Hispanic Americans through community-based programs operating at more than 700 LULAC councils nationwide. The organization involves and serves all Hispanic nationality groups.
    __label__intro;  LULAC strongly supports enhanced economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans, and we have been supporters of trade agreements in the past, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) over a decade ago. Today, however, we oppose the expansion of NAFTA to five additional Central American countries and the Dominican Republic through CAFTA.
    __label__intro;  Eleven years ago, we were promised that NAFTA would offer economic gains for U.S. Latinos and development for Mexico, that NAFTA side agreements would help raise labor and environmental standards on both sides of the border, and that substantial funds would be provided for U.S.-Mexico border clean-up efforts.
    __label__nonrel;  None of these promises have been kept. Instead, Hispanics have been disproportionately negatively impacted by these trade agreements. All told, nearly a million U.S. jobs have been lost in the United States due to NAFTA trade. The tragedy for Hispanics is that, according to a Government Accountability Office study, in some years as many as half of the workers displaced by NAFTA trade have been Hispanics, as Hispanics have consistently accounted for more of the Trade Adjustment Assistance certifications than their share of the U.S. population. Moreover, Hispanics have shared in the experience of most U.S. working families in seeing the median real wage scarcely grow since the 1970s, while productivity has grown over 80 percent and income inequality has skyrocketed.
    __label__development;  The deterioration of economic opportunity has extended to the other side of the border as well. In Mexico, 1 5 million farmers have been thrown off of their land as a result of NAFTA trade, while the Mexican minimum wage has lost nearly a fifth of its value and industrial wages a tenth of theirs. Mexicans' income growth has been particularly disappointing, not even a third of what they had prior to their period of trade liberalization. The real tragedy for development is that if the Mexican economy had continued to grow at its historic pace, Mexicans would have doubled their living standard by now and enjoyed near European living standards. CAFTA would replicate the same anti-development model.
    __label__nonrel;  At a minimum, LULAC and others that supported NAFTA were promised that any damage that might come about as a result of the agreement would be mitigated by the pact's labor and environmental side agreements. But these side agreements were left severely under funded and were never given real enforcement power. In short, they lacked the teeth to truly help improve and ensure the quality of life on both sides of the border.
    __label__environment;  The results of the San Diego-Tijuana Environmental Health Coalition's (EHC) landmark case concerning the Mexican government's refusal to clean up toxic waste left by an abandoned Tijuana factory, Metales y Derivados, is instructive. EHC's claim was processed and won through the adjudication procedures of the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (NACEC), which was created by NAFTA's environmental side agreement.However, despite the ruling, the NAFTA side agreement commission could not compel the cleanup of the more than 7,000 tons of toxic waste, which still lie exposed to the elements just a mile from the U.S. border. There have been a series of cases under NAFTA's investment rules in which corporations have been awarded cash compensation from governments based on claims of violations of their NAFTA-granted investor rights. In contrast, the only outcome of EHC's citizens-claim was a report from the commission acknowledging that there had been a violation, with no other result or penalty.
    __label__nonrel;  Other examples of NAFTA failure abound. The North American Commission on Labor Cooperation (NACLC), the tri-national NAFTA body that was supposed to ensure that countries enforced their own labor laws, never received its full funding. In fact, out of the $2 million a year in U.S. contributions that was authorized to be appropriated in the NAFTA implementing legislation, only a third was ever actually disbursed. This is a real tragedy given that even the authorized amount was woefully insufficient. Furthermore, the labor side agreement had such a cumbersome process for getting a review of labor rights violations that, as of today, 30 submissions has been made under the labor agreement, none of which have made it past the earliest stages of review, report and intergovernmental consultation. Not a single illegally fired worker has been reinstated, not a single independent union has been established and bargained collectively, and not a single workplace hazard has been corrected as a result of NAFTA and the NACLC.
    __label__nonrel;  Things were not much better for the NAFTA promises made for the border environment. Estimates for clean-up on the U.S.-Mexico border range from $8 to 21 billion, or six times the entire capital of the North American Development Bank (NADBank), established as a part of the NAFTA implementing legislation. But even the minimal promise was not kept. In fact, the U.S. Treasury Department reports that the NADBank had only directly loaned $23 5 million in low-interest loans to finance projects over its first seven years of operation, and disbursed only $11 million of that money—or less than 0.4 percent of its lending capacity— in large part because of the inability of impoverished border communities to afford the high interest rates and user fees. The promise that NADBank would dedicate ten percent of its capital to helping communities adjust to trade was also dramatically broken, as the bank's domestic adjustment window has made direct loans totaling only $7.84 million, or just over two percent of the $300 million envisaged.
    __label__position __label__development __label__immigration;  It is this history of failure to achieve the minimum of what was promised that informs LULAC's opposition to CAFTA. These unsuccessful policies have led to a doubling of undocumented migration to the United States from Mexico since NAFTA was enacted, and increased U.S. border policing and militarization that have led to more than 2,700 deaths from failed border crossings in desperate attempts to seek the American dream. We are concerned that CAFTA will preclude and prevent real and much needed economic and social development.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  In this regard, one ought to notice CAFTA's enhanced monopoly protection for brand name pharmaceuticals, a provision which led the U.S. Administration to directly pressure Guatemala to rescind a public health law expanding access to generic, low cost medicines. For many of the Central American countries, who experience relatively high rates of infant mortality and exposure to infectious diseases, such a provision is morally unacceptable.
    __label__humanrights __label__laborrights;  We are also concerned that the welfare of women, children and their families will be worsened under a CAFTA. Human Rights Watch has amply documented the labor standards of Central American countries, which fail to meet ILO standards and include instances of child labor on sugar plantations and the abuse of pregnant women in the export processing zones. LULAC has consistently spoken out against the abuses against women in the maquila industry on the U.S.-Mexico border, where violence and even disappearances of women have soared since NAFTA has taken place. The toothless labor provisions of CAFTA—like those of NAFTA before them—will hinder the efforts of civil and human rights groups to seek meaningful solutions to these problems.
    __label__development;  In short, LULAC believes that what Hispanics need is economic opportunity, and what Latin America needs is development. There is no evidence that this model of trade agreement, nor its side accords, have contributed in any way towards attaining this goal in the past, and there is no reason to think it would do so in the future with Central America. The track record is clear: the NAFTA/ CAFTA model has failed.
    __label__nonrel;  Finally, much has been made about CAFTA serving as a lifeboat for the Central American textile and apparel industry in the face of enhanced Chinese competition in following the global quota expiration. We know that the U.S., Mexican and Central American industries have indeed already lost much production to Asia. This loss will continue due to China's cost advantage—even after one accounts for shipping and tariff costs—over other regions. The NAFTA/ CAFTA model does nothing to change this reality. It offers a promise which it can never fulfill.
    __label__laborrights;  Central America already has duty-free access to the U.S. market under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and in CBI there are stronger incentives to use the U.S. inputs that Hispanics in the U.S. textile industry help produce, along with stronger mechanisms to force labor standards improvements in Central American countries. While some have suggested that the ability of the United States to impose safeguards on Chinese imports offers a relative advantage to the Central American apparel industry, U.S. law allows these to be applied only until 2008. The anti-development bias in the NAFTA/ CAFTA model, however, would last forever.
    __label__outro;  After three lost decades in terms of real gains in U.S. family incomes and Latin American growth rates, the cause of economic development and civil rights are best served without more of the same under CAFTA.
    __label__intro __label__position __label__jobs __label__exports __label__benchmark;  On behalf of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Entertainment Industry Coalition (EIC), of which MPAA is a member, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the committee for holding this hearing on the U.S.Dominican Republic Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR–CAFTA). The DRCAFTA creates new opportunities for America's entertainment industries and workers in terms of U.S. jobs and exports. This agreement also establishes important precedents for future Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to be negotiated with other countries.
    __label__intro;  The MPAA is a trade association representing the interests of seven of the largest producers and distributors of films, home video entertainment and television programs. Its members are Buena Vista Pictures Distribution; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.; Paramount Pictures; Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.; Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation; Universal Studios from Universal City Studios; and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.
    __label__intro;  The EIC is a coalition representing trade associations, guilds, a labor union and companies that produce, distribute and exhibit films, recorded music and video games. The coalition's members include the MPAA, the Recording Industry Association of America, the National Association of Theater Owners, Independent Film & Television Alliance and the Electronic Software Association.
    __label__iprights __label__jobs __label__growth;  The copyright industries reach across all fifty states and into almost every corner of the globe. The innovation and creative works they produce not only entertain us and make our lives easier; they represent an enormous engine of economic growth, prosperity and job opportunity. In 2002, the U.S. "core" copyright industries 1 accounted for an estimated 6% of the U.S. gross domestic product ($626.6 billion), and employed 4% of U.S. workers in 2002 (5.48 million workers). Between 1997-2002, the core copyright industries added workers at an annual rate of 1.33%, exceeding that of the U.S. economy as a whole (1.05%) by 27%. Factoring out the difficult economic year of 2002, between 1997-2001, employment in the core copyright industries grew at an annual growth rate of 3.19% per year, a rate more than double the annual employment rate achieved by the U.S. economy as a whole (1.39%).
    __label__nonrel;  In 2002, the U.S. "total" copyright industries 2 accounted for an estimated 12% of the U.S. gross domestic product ($1.25 trillion) and employed 8.41% of U.S. workers 'The "core" industries are those industries whose primary purpose is to produce or distribute copyright materials. These industries include newspapers, book publishing, recording, music, and periodicals, motion pictures, radio and television broadcasting, and computer software (including business application and entertainment software).
    __label__nonrel;  2 The "total" industries are composed of four groups called the core, partial, non-dedicated support, and interdependent sectors. (11.47 million workers). This level approaches the total employment levels of the entire health care and social assistance sector (15.3 million) and the entire U.S. manufacturing sector (14.5 million workers in 21 manufacturing industries). In 2002 the U.S. copyright industries achieved foreign sales and exports estimated at $89.26 billion, leading other major industry sectors such as: chemicals and related products, food and live animals, motor vehicles, parts, and accessories, and aircraft and associated equipment sectors.
   __label__iprights __label__jobs __label__enforcement __label__exports;  Protecting the copyright industries and the intellectual property they are based upon goes hand in hand with protecting the U.S. economy and job market. To that end, the DR–CAFTA provides for better intellectual property (IP) protections and more improved market access than the industry has seen in previous agreements. Central America and the Dominican Republic are currently pirate markets for the MPAA's member companies; this agreement would go a long way toward establishing legitimate markets and will help set the stage for effective enforcement of intellectual property laws. Moreover, the DR–CAFTA will set higher standards of IP protections and market access in future trade agreements.
   __label__iprights;  The DR–CAFTA builds on the framework of copyright protections provided by the World Trade Organization's agreement on trade related intellectual property. The signatories of the DR–CAFTA agree to implement the WIPO Internet Treaties, which provide world-class IP standards on treatment of digital copyrighted material, upon entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement. This establishes strong anti-circumvention provisions to prohibit tampering with technologies that are designed to prevent piracy and unauthorized distribution over the Internet. It also ensures that copyright owners have the exclusive right to make their works available online, and it provides an expeditious process that allows for copyright owners to engage with Internet Service Providers and subscribers to deal with allegedly infringing copyright material on the Internet. In addition, DR–CAFTA protects copyrighted works for extended terms, in line with emerging international trends.
   __label__iprights __label__enforcement;  The DR–CAFTA offers strengthened intellectual property enforcement in several ways. The agreement increases in criminal and civil protection against the unlawful decoding and distribution of encrypted satellite TV signals, and it criminalizes end-user piracy, providing strong deterrence against piracy and counterfeiting. It requires both parties to authorize the seizure, forfeit, and destruction of pirated products and the equipment used to produce them and also provides for enforcement against goods-in-transit, to deter violators from using ports or free trade zones to traffic in pirated products. In addition, it includes agreed criminal standards for copyright infringement and stronger remedies and penalties.
   __label__iprights;  The members of the MPAA have had a long-standing and serious problem with broadcast piracy—the unlicensed and illegal retransmission of broadcast signals—in the Dominican Republic. However, an August 5, 2004 side letter to the DRCAFTA agreement already provides a strong commitment to eliminate broadcast piracy by the Government of the Dominican Republic. One favorable judgment against a notorious pirate broadcaster was received late last year.
   __label__forbarriersred;  The Agreement committed to zero tariffs on all movies, music, consumer products, software, books and magazines that our companies export into the countries. It also reaffirmed that customs duties are based on the value of carrier media and not the value of the movie, music, or software contained on the carrier media in order to assist in efforts to create global consensus on this customs valuation standard.
   __label__forbarriersred;  DR–CAFTA demonstrates that a trade agreement can harmonize two important objectives—trade liberalization and the promotion of cultural diversity. It avoids the "cultural exceptions" approach, while demonstrating that a trade agreement has sufficient flexibility to take into account countries' cultural promotion interests. This agreement includes important provisions to ensure market access for U.S. films and television programs over a variety of media including cable, satellite, and the Internet. It also has strong investment protections that will benefit theater chains. U.S. cinemas are building new multiplexes in Central American countries and the investment protections that they receive in DR–CAFTA will help to protect and promote their growth. These multiplexes in turn provide an important base for expanding the filmed entertainment market.
    __label__forbarriersred;  The Agreement also has broad commitments to open services markets (with few exceptions) across a range of sectors important to the entertainment industries, including but not limited to computer and related services, telecommunications services, audiovisual services, advertising, and distribution services, such as wholesaling and retailing. In addition, there are disciplines that ensure a more competitive telecommunications market including disciplines that require cost-based Internet access (through leased circuit services). Such disciplines will be particularly important in safeguarding competition against Costa Rican state-owned telecomm company.
    __label__ecommerce;  The Agreement contains groundbreaking commitments on e-commerce, which will help stimulate development of advanced telecommunications infrastructure in these countries. These commitments will in turn ensure benefits for the filmed entertainment industry under this Agreement far into the future. The DR—CAFTA also includes a commitment to non-discriminatory treatment of digital products including DVDs and CDs; and agreement not to impose customs duties on such products.
    __label__forbarriersred;  The Chief Executive Officer of the Motion Picture Association of America would not generally be expected to opine on issues involving trade in agriculture. But, as a former Secretary of Agriculture, I was honored to join five other former Secretaries of Agriculture: Ann Veneman, Mike Espy, Clayton Yeutter, John Block and Bob Bergland in a letter released on April 19, 2005, in recognizing the significant benefits this Agreement will bring to U.S. farmers, ranches, food and agriculture organizations and in urging members of congress to support this Agreement. A copy of our letter is attached.
    __label__outro __label__position;  In conclusion, the Motion Picture Association of America has long been appreciative of the leadership shown by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in negotiating important provisions for good market access and intellectual property rights protections in previous FTAs, and we thank them again for their hard work on the DR—CAFTA. In turn, Congress has in the past and should again recognize the importance of these agreements to the U.S. economy and job market by approving them. On behalf of the MPAA, its member companies, and the members of the Entertainment Industry Coalition, I hope that Congress will vote in favor of the U.S.-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement and the job opportunities, market expansion, and strong intellectual property and investment protections it provides to the entertainment industry. Thank you.
    __label__intro __label__position;  As former secretaries of agriculture, we understand the importance of negotiating trade deals that minimize the costs and maximize the benefits to U.S. farmers, ranchers, and food and agriculture organizations. We support the Free Trade Agreement with Central America and the Dominican Republic (CAFTA—DR) because the benefits are very significant and the costs are minimal. We urge you to pass CAFTA—DR quickly and without amendment.
    __label__forbarriersred;  A vote for CAFTA—DR is a vote for fairness and for reciprocal market access. Under CAFTA—DR all of our food and farm products will receive duty free treatment when the agreement is fully implemented.
    __label__forbarriersred;  A vote against CAFTA—DR is a vote for one-way trade. Virtually all of what we import from the six CAFTA countries now enters the U.S. duty free as a result of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Yet, our food and agricultural exports to these six nations are restricted significantly because of high tariffs. As a result of the current one-way trade deal, we are running an agricultural trade deficit with these six countries.
    __label__growth __label__exports;  In addition, a formal trade agreement with the United States will help ensure the economic stability and growth that the region needs to avoid a return to the civil wars, insurgencies, and dictatorships of the recent past. As economic freedom and democracy take deeper root, incomes will increase and demand for our food and agriculture products will expand.
    __label__usleadership;  Failure to approve CAFTA—DR will have a devastating effect on U.S. efforts to negotiate trade agreements on behalf of U.S. agriculture. The World Trade Organization Doha Development Round would be dealt a serious blow. Other countries would be less willing to negotiate with the United States knowing that CAFTA–DR, a trade agreement so clearly beneficial to U.S. interests, could be rejected by the U.S. Congress.
    __label__exports __label__outro;  The future of American agriculture continues to lay in expanding opportunities for our exports in the global marketplace, where 96 percent of the world's population lives. We must not forego these opportunities, especially when the benefits to our nation are so unmistakable.
    __label__intro __label__exports __label__sourcing;  Congress is considering the most significant trade liberalization agreement since passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) more than 10 years ago. The Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) was signed last year by the United States and Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. These six nations make up the second largest market for U.S. goods exports in Latin America, behind only Mexico. They purchased $15.1 billion worth of U.S. exports in 2003, an increase of 11 percent from 2000. Meanwhile, U.S. imports from the region totaled $16.8 billion in 2003, up 4 percent from 2000, making it the 15th-largest supplier to U.S. consumers and businesses.1
    __label__forbarriersred;  CAFTA is the first major test of the Trade Promotion Authority sought by President Clinton and finally granted to President Bush. It would eliminate tariffs on most goods and services and substantially reduce other trade barriers.
    __label__position;  Unfortunately, passage of CAFTA is in doubt. Its defeat would be a setback for wider efforts to expand trade and thereby improve economic conditions in poor developing countries. More than 100 Democrats voted for NAFTA, but apparently CAFTA does not enjoy similar bipartisan support. There is also weakness among some Republicans.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__impcomp;  Both opponents and supporters of freer trade have complaints about CAFTA: Free traders are disappointed that it exempts two domestic industries that are protected from overseas competition—sugar and textiles—and delays the elimination of some trade barriers by a decade or more. Opponents of liberalized trade claim that increasing imports will harm U.S. workers, and some of them claim (somewhat contradictorily) that increased exports from the region will harm workers in those countries.
    __label__alltrade __label__growth;  Mutual Gains from Trade. Setting aside the objections of rent-seeking economic interests that support trade barriers simply because tariffs and regulations limit their competitors, opposition to trade liberalization is based on a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of trade. Both buyer and seller benefit from any exchange, whether it is a purchase from a local convenience store or a worker exchanging his or her labor for a wage. In fact, exchange is the principal way in which humans create wealth and raise their living standards. Similarly, the economies of both importing and exporting countries benefit from the international exchange of goods and services.
    __label__nonrel;  None of us asks of prices charged at the 7-Eleven: "Is it fair? Is it just?" We ask: "Is it too high?" Or, "Is it a bargain?" And of course, if the price is lower than that charged by competing stores, we don't ask, "Shouldn't I pay more?" Yet there is a presumption among misguided opponents of international trade that unless trade is "fair" or "just," someone loses out. None of us says to the clerk at 7-Eleven: "I will not buy your products unless you patronize my business." Yet with respect to international trade, some claim we should only buy from other countries exactly as much as they purchase from ours.
    __label__development __label__consumers;  The gains from trade are mutual, but they are seldom equal. In the case of CAFTA, because the six developing countries that have entered into the agreement with United States are poorer and have more protectionist trade policies than we do, they have more at stake. It is true that U.S. producers and workers will benefit
    __label__growth;  Benefits of Economic Growth. The reduction in trade barriers in the six CAFTA countries will benefit the poor in those countries by raising rates of economic growth. Empirical economic research has established that nations that trade more enjoy higher rates of economic growth and hence higher living standards, measured in per capita gross domestic product.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Tariff rates in most of the CAFTA partners are two to three times higher than in the United States. They already have duty-free access to the U.S. market under the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) program. In fact, most of the products on which U.S. tariffs fall to zero immediately under CAFTA are already afforded duty-free access under the provisions of the CBTPA. Under CAFTA, however, there will be fewer restrictions and lower compliance costs to qualify for preferential access. The difference between the CBTPA and CAFTA is that CAFTA will grant American goods that are currently subject to tariffs duty-free access to Central American markets. On average, 75 percent of the tariff product categories will be duty-free for U.S. exports to the region upon enactment of the agreement.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__growth;  There is a link between openness to trade and economic growth. According to the World Bank, tariff rates in almost all of the CAFTA countries are significantly higher than United States' average of 2.6 percent.2 Specifically, the most recent data available show weighted average tariffs of 10.1 percent in the Dominican Republic, 5.8 percent in Costa Rica, 6.1 percent in El Salvador, 5.8 percent in Guatemala, 7.3 percent in Honduras and 2.3 percent in Nicaragua. These countries are also relatively poor, with per capita GDPs (in terms of local purchasing power) ranging from $2,200 in Nicaragua to $9,000 in Costa Rica, compared to about $38,000 in the United States.
    __label__growth __label__poverty;  Larger nations with bigger economies have faster growth than smaller ones because larger economies experience higher growth. This puts smaller economies at a disadvantage. However, smaller economies can tap into the economic robustness of larger economies through trade. According to economists Alberto F. Ades and Edward L. Glaeser, the initial size of the economy in open, or trading, nations has a minimal role in determining the rate of GDP growth.3 The initial size of the economy has a larger role for a relatively closed economy, in which trade accounts for less than 22 percent of GDP. Thus, they conclude that contrary to protectionists' beliefs, free trade benefits poorer nations.
    __label__democratization;  The CAFTA countries have already made progress due to trade liberalization spurred by CBTPA and the democratization that has occurred in these countries. Between 1991 and 2001 the average ratio of imports to GDP for the six countries rose from 33 percent to 49 percent. Moreover, on a range of social indicators, all six countries have made progress.
    __label__development;  According to the World Bank, literacy rates for men and women 15 and older have risen significantly in every one of the CAFTA-plus countries since 1980.4 In fact, between 1980 and 2001, the average literacy rate in the region increased from 67 percent to above 80 percent; the percentage of children aged 10 to 14 in the workforce has steadily declined; and the average share of children in the labor force has dropped from 17.4 percent in 1980 to 10.0 percent in 2002. Expanding trade with the United States would accelerate this progress.
    __label__outro __label__growth __label__development;  Conclusion. CAFTA would substantially liberalize trade and investment and encourage further economic liberalization among America's trade partners. It would open economic opportunities for the United States, Central America, and the Dominican Republic and set the stage for economic growth and social development.
    __label__intro;  NEMA is the largest trade association representing the interests of U.S. electrical industry manufacturers, whose worldwide annual sales of electrical products exceed $130 billion. Our more than 400 member companies manufacture products used in the generation, transmission, distribution, control, and use of electricity. These products are used in utility, industrial, commercial, institutional and residential installations. The Association's Medical Products Division represents manufacturers of medical diagnostic imaging equipment including MRI, CT, x-ray, ultrasound and nuclear products.
    __label__position __label__forbarriersred;  This Agreement is essentially a one-way, favorable deal for the United States. Since these six countries already enjoy ready U.S. market access for items in our Association's product scope, it levels the playing field for manufacturers in our sector by featuring foreign tariff elimination, much of it immediate. In fact, based on current annual trade levels, over $1 billion worth of tariffs applied on U.S. exports in our sector will be eliminated when the Agreement takes effect. This Agreement also promises to reduce non-tariff barriers and benefit joint efforts to eliminate counterfeit products.
    __label__exports;  NEMA members already enjoy surprising levels of commerce with these nations despite their frequently high duties, and our exports stand to expand even further under the Agreement:

    __label__intro;  Oxfam is an international development and humanitarian relief agency committed to developing lasting solutions to poverty, hunger and social injustice. We work in over 120 countries around the globe, including the five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic that are party to the free trade agreement with the United States, known as DR—CAFTA.
    __label__nonrel;  Oxfam believes that trade can be an important means to achieving sustainable development and poverty reduction. Trade and development are intimately linked. A global system that has fair trade rules and practices has the potential to lift millions of people out of poverty. For this reason, Oxfam has focused on making global trade rules fair and consistent with development goals, as an integral part of our work to improve livelihoods and reduce poverty in developing countries.
    __label__nonrel;  Trade agreements present both opportunities and risks, especially when they involve developed and developing countries. The DR—CAFTA is the first such agreement the U.S. has negotiated with some of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, two of which have annual per capita incomes below $1,000. The U.S. trading partners in the DR—CAFTA, with a population of 42 5 million, have high levels of poverty and very unequal distributions of income and wealth. They depend heavily on agriculture for the livelihood of significant portions of their populations. These countries are ravaged by curable diseases due to poverty and inadequate health-care coverage. They sorely lack public infrastructure and, in several cases, are highly indebted.
    __label__poverty;  In order for a trade agreement to be fair for these countries and promote their development, it must ensure that governments are able to provide for the food security needs of their people. And for an agreement to contribute to their poverty reduction, it must not prevent citizens from being able to access life-saving drugs they desperately need to effectively combat contagious diseases like HIV/AIDS or prevalent illnesses like diabetes. Trade agreements inevitably have winners and losers. Oxfam believes that those who stand to lose in the DR—CAFTA are the ones who are already disadvantaged in these highly unequal societies, where the majority of poor people live in rural areas, rely on income from agriculture and must pay for medicines out-of-pocket.
   __label__position __label__security;  There has been much public debate about what the passage or rejection of the DR–CAFTA will mean for the U.S. trade agenda. Oxfam, however, believes that the DR–CAFTA must be judged only on the basis of what this particular agreement will mean specifically for the seven countries involved. Congress should look carefully at the terms of the DR–CAFTA to understand their implications in a region of high geo-political importance to our country. On balance, Oxfam believes the agreement, in its current form, will do more harm than good. It will threaten the livelihoods of millions in Central America and the Dominican Republic and may contribute to increased insecurity and instability in that region.
   __label__iprights __label__fdi __label__position;  Oxfam wishes to focus attention on provisions in the DR–CAFTA involving agriculture, intellectual property and investment. As a result of our analysis in these areas, Oxfam believes the DR–CAFTA is a bad deal for millions of farmers, workers, and consumers in Central America and the Dominican Republic and should therefore be rejected.
   __label__nonrel;  Agriculture currently comprises between 10 to 23 percent of GDP in the six DRCAFTA trading partners, while it represents less than two percent of GDP in the U.S. Nearly a third of employment in these six countries depends on agriculture, much of which involves food essentials for consumption in the region, and most of these workers are poor and low skilled.
   __label__econsecurity __label__forbarriersred;  There are two major reasons why Oxfam believes many farmers in Central America and the Dominican Republic are at significant risk of losing their livelihood under DR–CAFTA. Market access rules for agriculture in the agreement deny developing country governments the ability to adopt measures to ensure domestic food security and promote rural livelihoods. Under DR–CAFTA, countries must eliminate import tariffs on virtually all agricultural goods, including those food essentials that are most important for small farmers' incomes—rice, yellow corn, beans and dairy products.
   __label__dumping __label__poverty;  At the same time, the agreement requires Central American countries and the Dominican Republic to open the door for dumping of highly subsidized U.S. agricultural exports at prices below their cost of production. This situation is not only profoundly unfair, but it risks creating poverty and economic dislocations among the 5.5 million farmers and farmworkers in the region.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__exports;  Although DR–CAFTA provides for longer tariff elimination periods for some basic commodities in Central America and the Dominican Republic, duty-free quotas are immediately created or expanded beginning in the first year of the agreement. These duty-free quotas are nearly equal to current U.S. exports to these markets (quotas begin to surpass current U.S. export levels starting in the second year of DR–CAFTA) and will immediately drive down prices for local producers. The region's small farmers—who receive no subsidies, lack access to credit and depend on the income from each year's harvest for their subsistence—will be unable to compete with subsidized U.S. exports. And as more local farmers go out of business each year, the region's grain imports in following years are likely to surpass the annual quota increases, as occurred in Mexico under NAFTA, making the longer tariff phase-out periods irrelevant.
   __label__nonrel;  The case of corn in Mexico under NAFTA is illustrative. An extended 15-year period for tariff elimination was instead reduced to little more than 30 months, and real corn prices in Mexico fell more than 70 percent in the first eight years under NAFTA, without benefiting Mexican consumers. It is estimated that since NAFTA's passage, 1 7 million Mexican peasants working in the agricultural sector have lost their jobs. In addition, 15 million small farmers have lost significant income because they could not compete with subsidized U.S. exports, such as corn. Many left their land and fled to urban areas. It is no coincidence that the number of Mexicans crossing the U.S. border without authorization seeking employment and a better life more than doubled between 1990 and 2000—with most of that growth occurring after NAFTA went into effect in 1994—and has continued to increase in this decade.
   __label__jobs;  A similar outcome can be expected under the DR–CAFTA for producers of basic grains such as rice. In fact, the experience of the rice sector in Honduras in the 1990s offers a case study of the likely impact on small farmers in the region. In 1991, the Honduran government cut tariffs on rice imports to make up for a shortage due to drought, and a flood of imports at harvest time equivalent to the country's annual consumption left local producers without a market. Rice prices fell by more than 28 percent in one year and, as a result, areas under rice cultivation decreased by 35 percent the following year. Over a decade, the number of rice producers dropped from 25,000 to fewer than 2,000, and the jobs generated from rice production fell from 150,000 to 11,200. As a result, rice production was reduced by 86 percent between 1991 and 2002, and the amount of foreign exchange spent on rice imports increased 20-fold (from $1 million in 1989 to $20 million in 2003). At the same time, the price of rice to consumers rose 140 percent in nominal terms, or 12 percent in dollar terms, over the decade.
    __label__development;  The market access rules for agriculture in the DR–CAFTA deny developing country governments the policy flexibilities necessary to promote rural development, protect livelihoods, and provide food security to their citizens. The agreement negates the principle governing multilateral trade negotiations for the past 50 years that developing countries are not required to make reciprocal commitments to reduce trade barriers if these are inconsistent with their individual development needs. Instead, the DR–CAFTA does not incorporate pro-development concepts, such as special and differential treatment, and precludes use of flexibilities available to developing countries at the WTO. It does not allow developing countries to use differentiated tariff reduction formulae or designate special products eligible for more flexible treatment. It prohibits the use of the WTO safeguard, and the safeguard mechanism provided under DR–CAFTA is weak and temporary: a price drop could render it useless since it is linked to volume instead of prices of imports, and it can only be applied until the tariff is completely phased out.
    __label__growth __label__poverty __label__immigration;  This will have a devastating impact on the 5 5 million Central Americans who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. What will the U.S. gain at the expense of the loss of livelihoods of small farmers in Central America and the Dominican Republic? According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, U.S. grain exports can be expected to expand by 1.2 percent annually once tariffs are fully eliminated under DR–CAFTA. Overall, the market access provisions are expected to increase U.S. GDP by less than 0.01 percent annually. Considering the cost in terms of increased poverty and social problems for our neighbors, not to mention the potential increase in immigration to our borders, the DR–CAFTA is not only a bad deal for development in the region, but it provides no appreciable benefits to U.S. citizens.
    __label__iprights;  The rules on intellectual property in DR–CAFTA are another serious area of concern for Oxfam. All of the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic are WTO members and are therefore bound to implement the intellectual property provisions in the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights, known as "TRIPS". But the DR–CAFTA goes well beyond the existing TRIPS provisions, imposing new so-called TRIPS-plus provisions related to pharmaceuticals. Most of these provisions are aimed at delaying the introduction of generic competition, thereby prolonging a patent holder's monopoly over the marketing of a medicine. When generic drugs cannot enter the market to compete with brand-named products, drug prices are higher and fewer people have access to medicines.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  At the heart of intellectual property rights systems is a balance between the rights of patent holders and the public interest. In particular, determining the appropriate balance between protections related to pharmaceuticals and public health is a complex task still being debated in the United States—for example, the "drug re-importation" debate in Congress. Oxfam does not believe that there is one "size" of intellectual property protection that fits all, however. The appropriate balance depends upon a variety of factors, such as the level of poverty in a country, the likelihood that protections will generate innovation, and the real-world effects from higher medicine prices resulting from protections.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  Many public health and intellectual property experts have warned that TRIPS-plus provisions may undermine public health in poor countries, without generating any appreciable gains in innovation. This concern became a major issue at the WTO, and the importance of preserving public health was affirmed in the 2001 Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health in 2001 by all WTO members, including the United States. The Doha Declaration confirmed that WTO members may use "flexibilities" built into TRIPS to modify intellectual property rules to address public health needs, and constitutes a commitment to favor public health over intellectual property rights.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  In 2002, Congress endorsed this commitment as part of Trade Promotion Authority, under which DR–CAFTA was negotiated, by instructing the U.S. Trade Representative to respect the Doha Declaration in trade negotiations (Section 2102(b)(4)(C) of the Trade Act of 2002). Yet USTR has ignored the direction of both the WTO and Congress by forcing the governments of Central America and the Dominican Republic to adopt some of the highest levels of intellectual property protections for drugs in the world. This completely undermines the protections for public health laid out in the Doha Declaration. Oxfam believes that many of these provisions are not suitable for the small, poor developing economies in Central America and will result in reduced access to needed medicines and therapies, with no appreciable benefit in innovation or research and development spending.
    __label__iprights;  Many of the intellectual property provisions in DR–CAFTA tip the balance of intellectual property protections in favor of the short-term commercial interests of U.S. pharmaceutical companies, at the expense of public health. These provisions:
 __label__iprights;  * Extend patent protection beyond the 20-year period required under TRIPS. Contrary to U.S. law, no upper limit is placed on such extensions. Twenty years of patent protection is more than an adequate monopoly for patent holders to recover investments and generate profits. Extending this monopoly period unfairly favors patent holders to the detriment of the broader public interest in accessing affordable medicines.
 __label__iprights;  * Require test data protection for periods of up to 10 years. These rules will delay for up to 10 years the introduction of generic medicines, even in the absence of patent barriers.
 __label__iprights;  * Effectively eliminate the ability of Central American countries and the Dominican Republic to use compulsory licensing, a key tool available to governments to meet their citizens' public health needs. Compulsory licenses provide an important safeguard to governments to counterbalance the monopoly rights granted to patent holders. Both developing and developed countries—including the United States—have used compulsory licenses or the threat of them to bring down medicine prices.
 __label__iprights __label__enforcement;  * Force national drug registration authorities to serve as patent police, which prevents these authorities from granting marketing approval for generic versions of drugs until after the patent expires. This could prevent or delay access to affordable generic versions of new medicines, as well as undermine the use of compulsory licenses. Furthermore, this goes beyond U.S. law, which places the burden on the patent owner to enforce its own rights. DR–CAFTA forces the government to bear the cost, expense, and delay of enforcing private patent rights.
    __label__iprights;  When the DR–CAFTA was signed on August 5, 2004, a side letter or "understanding" on intellectual property and public health was included in response to criticism that the intellectual property restrictions in the agreement could undermine public health. However, this "understanding' does nothing to allay Oxfam's concerns with these provisions. In reality, it merely states that CAFTA provisions "do not affect a Party's ability to take necessary measures to protect public health by promoting access to medicines for all" or from "effective utilization" of the WTO decision on TRIPS. This clause is virtually meaningless from a legal standpoint because it is just a declaratory statement, similar to a preamble or an objective. It is not a legally binding exception to the very clear obligations in the Agreement but at best has interpretive value. USTR has studiously avoided describing the "understanding" as a legally binding exception.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  Oxfam believes that TRIPS-plus provisions relating to pharmaceuticals should not be included in a trade agreement with Central America and the Dominican Republic. Central America has the second highest death rate from communicable diseases in Latin America. Over 165,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS and more than 30,000 cases of full-blown AIDS have been reported in the region. Resources for public health in the DR–CAFTA countries are extremely limited. Medicines sold at monopoly prices are too costly for these countries to provide through their public health systems and too expensive for poor people to pay for out-of-pocket. These countries should be able to use the TRIPS public-health safeguards to the fullest to protect public health and promote access to medicines for all, as affirmed by the Doha Declaration.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  DR–CAFTA is often described as a "cutting-edge" trade agreement that will serve as a model for future trade agreements. Oxfam feels this is a grim prospect. Imposing new intellectual property burdens on developing countries that increase the cost of medicines for poor people is a very bad model indeed, particularly looking towards the other countries with which the U.S. is currently negotiating trade agreements.
    __label__fdi __label__capcontrols;  Investment rules in the DR–CAFTA are another important concern for Oxfam in this trade agreement. These rules are clear and strong on the rights of foreign investors, but say little about the rights and obligations of governments to ensure that investors behave responsibly and that investment serves the public good. Specifically, DR–CAFTA restricts governments' ability to regulate foreign investment through the use of measures such as performance requirements, technology transfers, and capital controls. Oxfam believes that prohibiting pro-development measures such as these will reduce the positive impact that investment in the region can have and may create large new financial and policy burdens for already overstretched governments.
    __label__fdi;  In Central America and the Dominican Republic, increased investment is critical to achieving sustainable development. Yet several recent studies show that trade and investment agreements themselves do not stimulate additional foreign investment. Rather, macroeconomic and political stability, as well as market size, are determining factors. Furthermore, Oxfam believes that the quality—not just quantity—of investment is key in promoting development. Positive incentives to direct investment can help distribute wealth and promote economic growth, which can result in improved livelihoods. By setting performance requirements, governments can ensure the use of local inputs, which helps create backward linkages to the domestic economy. Through technology transfers, governments can help establish valuable linkages between foreign and domestic producers.
    __label__fdi __label__development;  However, DR–CAFTA will forbid governments from using local content rules and technology transfers. Without the flexibility to utilize these measures, governments are powerless to direct investment so that it benefits the rest of the domestic economy. This will lead to a scenario in which a limited number of investors may prosper without contributing more broadly to sustainable growth in the countries where they operate. This defies the spirit of the DR–CAFTA agreement, which claims to have the development of Central America and the Dominican Republic as one of its goals.
    __label__nonrel;  Much of the foreign direct investment recently flowing into the region has been directed towards maquiladora factories or export processing zones, mostly for garments manufacturing. While these factories do provide some badly needed jobs, they usually contribute little to the overall economy because of the enclave nature of their production. Moreover, jobs in these factories are increasingly at risk with the removal of global quotas for textiles and apparel.
    __label__fdi __label__capcontrols;  Oxfam is also concerned that DR–CAFTA forbids restrictions on the repatriation of profits and limits governments' ability to impose controls on highly speculative investments. This means that foreign investors in the region will have unrestricted ability to bring capital into and out of countries, while governments will have little recourse to deal with economic instability, should investors suddenly pull their money out of the country. While a stable business climate is important, so too is ensuring that investment contributes to domestic growth and broad-based sustainable development. Unregulated capital flight can have devastating consequences, especially in case of a financial meltdown, such as occurred in Argentina in 2001.
    __label__fdi __label__dispute;  Also of serious concern is the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in the DR–CAFTA, which, similar to NAFTA, will enable foreign investors to bring suits before international arbitral tribunals when they believe their business interests have been impaired by government regulatory actions. Investment rules in the DRCAFTA broadly define what constitutes an expropriation and leave open the possibility that these ad-hoc tribunals will interpret social and environmental regulations as an "indirect expropriation." Thus, foreign investors will be able to challenge laws or regulations at the national, state or local levels, even if these are enacted for legitimate public interest objectives, including public health, safety, and environmental protection.
    __label__fdi __label__dispute __label__transparency;  These special international tribunals are neither open to the public nor accountable to democratic processes. They lack the transparency generally afforded by normal judicial proceedings, yet are empowered to order governments to directly compensate investors for regulations that hurt them, regardless of the public good that the regulations might serve. Claimants are not required to exhaust domestic judicial remedies before bringing investment claims to these international tribunals, thus allowing foreign investors to bypass domestic legal systems. Although the DR–CAFTA was intended to strengthen and support democratic institutions in Central America and the Dominican Republic, it may actually undermine the judiciaries in the region.
    __label__fdi __label__dispute;  This dispute settlement mechanism has been used to challenge important regulations that are expressly designed to protect public health, safety, the environment, and other public interest objectives that enhance social welfare. To date, over 40 suits have been filed by corporations under NAFTA's investment rules in special tribunals, seeking $28 billion in claims from the U.S., Canadian and Mexican governments. If NAFTA is any indication, the investment provisions of DR–CAFTA could create large new liabilities for the governments of Central America and the Dominican Republic. Perhaps more problematic is the chilling effect the threat of litigation by investors could create on policy-makers interested in generating new environmental, public-health, and pro-development safeguards.
    __label__fdi __label__dispute;  Highlighting this problem is a bitter dispute between Canadian-owned Glamis Gold, Ltd., which is seeking to construct a mine in San Miguel, Guatemala, and the local citizens who oppose the project. Backed by the Catholic Church, local residents fear that the mining project will wreak havoc on the local environment. They successfully pressured the Guatemalan government to agree to freeze issuance of future mining permits. However, under DR–CAFTA, foreign investors will be able to challenge local measures like this one, claiming discrimination as foreign investors. At risk will be governments' ability to provide effective regulation to protect workers, health and safety, and the environment. Any agreement that contains investment rules that limits governments' ability to protect the health and well-being of its citizens should be opposed.
    __label__poverty;  CAFTA is likely to increase inequality and exacerbate poverty in a region that is still struggling to recover from the devastation of wars, hurricanes and droughts. Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), Congress established trade preferences to facilitate the economic development and export diversification of the CaribbeanBasin economies. These benefits were permanently extended in 1990, and in 2000 the list of products eligible for duty-free access to the U.S. market was expanded, in part in response to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Mitch. Nevertheless, the region continues to suffer from serious problems of poverty and inequality.
    __label__position;  Oxfam believes it is in the interest of the United States to promote economic development in the region, including increased development assistance, institution-building, and increased trade. However, the DR–CAFTA is, at best, a mixed bag. The agreement provides very modest and incremental trading opportunities for our poorer neighbors, while it imposes major new obligations and restrictions in the process.
    __label__nonrel;  In general, Oxfam believes that the U.S. trade negotiation strategy has set the wrong priorities. With limited resources, the USTR has pursued numerous smaller bilateral and regional trade agreements even while a much bigger, and more important, trade agreement has stalled. For both the U.S. and the world, the WTO Doha Round offers potential benefits that are orders of magnitude larger than those in free trade agreements with small countries such as DR–CAFTA. While negotiating trade agreements at the global level is certainly a messy and cumbersome process, the alternative is a very scattered and asymmetrical trading scheme that adds complexity and increases entry costs. This is not good for the U.S., but it is far worse for developing countries, many of which are already very marginal players in global trade. And while the U.S. is likely to have to make more concessions—particularly in agriculture—at the multilateral level, than in bilateral agreements, this is where the U.S. can demand concessions from other rich countries like Europe and Japan. Investing in, rather than neglecting, the WTO and the Doha Round, will help build a more common, rules-based system that provides more opportunity and stability for both the U.S. and developing countries.
    __label__outro __label__position;  The rules set forth in the DR–CAFTA on agriculture, intellectual property, and investment add up to a bad deal for farmers, workers, and consumers in Central America and the Dominican Republic. Rather than setting out provisions that will foster broad-based economic growth and sustainable development, DR–CAFTA will put millions of poor people at risk of losing their livelihood. The U.S. should do better if it wants to promote peace, political stability, and economic security in this region that has struggled with poverty and inequality, and the resulting instability, for so long. Unfortunately, the DR–CAFTA is wrong way to achieve these goals, which is why Oxfam urges Congress to vote no.
    __label__intro;  Chairman Thomas and Ranking Member Rangel, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Central American Free Trade Agreement or CAFTA. This is an important agreement between the United States and six countries that are key to our economic and national security: El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. We know that this is a highly complex agreement and we want to commend this Committee for all of its hard work in fostering free trade around the world.
   __label__position;  As Chairman of the Financial Services Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade and Technology of the Financial Services Committee, we submit this statement to support free trade in financial services. U.S. firms often face restrictions in their ability to operate globally. The concept of national treatment, where foreign firms are treated like domestic firms, is not the norm in all Central American nations. As a result, U.S. banks, insurance providers, and securities dealers are often subject to non-transparent and discriminatory regulations which inhibit their ability to compete in these markets. The CAFTA agreement goes a long way to remedy many of these problems.
    __label__jobs __label__exports;  Services industries account for nearly 80 percent of U.S. employment as well as GDP. This includes lawyers, architects, engineers, doctors and, of course, financial service providers. Over the past 10 years, U.S. services exports nearly doubled to $270 billion. Trade in financial services accounts for a high percentage of U.S. services exports.
    __label__exports;  We often hear about the trade deficit that the U.S. has with other nations. What we don't hear about is that in case of trade in services, we actually have a surplus. Our nation leads the world in financial services innovation. This agreement will help extend that surplus and promote state-of-the art financial services globally.
    __label__transparency __label__forbarriersred;  The CAFTA agreement will allow U.S. financial firms to access these countries on a fair footing with their local counterparts. It will promote transparency in the rules that govern how these enterprises are supervised. Without CAFTA, the financial services sector will be limited in its ability to enter these markets, will have restrictions on the ability to establish branch offices, and the regulations overseeing the operations of these institutions will be written behind closed doors. CAFTA will require national treatment and MFN treatment, prohibit quantitative restrictions on market access of financial institutions, and bar restrictions on the nationality of senior management.
    __label__forbarriersred;  Now, we know that the financial services markets in the CAFTA countries are not going to be major revenue generators for U.S. financial firms in the short-run. However, these are long-term strategic growth markets for our financial firms. Our economic prosperity will be strengthened if trade barriers between our nations are eliminated.
    __label__development __label__econsecurity __label__fdi __label__exports;  Economic prosperity in the region, which will foster economic security in the hemisphere, will also grow as competition in the financial services sector within CAFTA countries expands the availability of capital to fund new ventures. Over time, it will also yield a wide range of benefits, including more customers for our firms and more efficient markets within our hemisphere. Improved access to sophisticated financial services, backed by sound regulation, will enable these markets to grow to become buyers of other U.S. products. Without the development of these financial markets, manufacturers will be less likely to cultivate customers in this region.
    __label__outro;  The Financial Services Committee has taken a leadership role in ensuring strong financial services provisions in this agreement, as well as the Chile and Singapore agreements. In December of 2003, the Committee wrote Ambassador Zoellick urging him not to accept a trade agreement that permitted Costa Rica to retain the government's monopoly on insurance. The CAFTA agreement now includes provisions permitting U.S. firms to provide insurance products in Costa Rica. We would like to submit a copy of this letter for the record.
    __label__outro __label__position;  In closing, we strongly urge the Members of this Committee to support the CAFTA Agreement. It will foster economic security in our hemisphere and will promote the exchange of goods and services between our countries.

    __label__intro;  CAFTA, signed in May 2004, would expand the economic model established in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to five Central American countries and the Dominican Republic. If approved, CAFTA, like NAFTA, would require its signatory countries to conform their domestic policies and practices to a broad array of non-trade dictates, for example regarding the regulation of service sector companies and foreign investors' operations in other economic sectors operating within a signatory nation's territory. It would require signatories to provide certain patent medicine and seed protections that have been criticized by health and consumer groups worldwide as undermining consumers' access to these essential 'goods.' It even sets constraints on how countries and other political entities may spend their own tax revenues. In addition, CAFTA contains the same model of interconnected trade rules and foreign investor protections that together create incentives that motivate business operations seek out the most profitable sites and processes for production, even if these are often contrary to the public interest.
    __label__intro;  An analysis of CAFTA's provisions reveals that it replicated NAFTA's provisions to a high degree—often with identical language. Thus, there is much that we can learn from the 11-year record of NAFTA, which CAFTA would expand to additional nations.
    __label__position;  1. CAFTA NAFTA Expansion is an Outsourcing Agreement: Eleven-Year Record Demonstrates that the NFATA Model Lowered Living Standards on Both Sides of the Border
    __label__nonrel;  Since 1994, the United States has lost nearly 1 million jobs on net due to NAFTA trade,1 with one in six U.S. manufacturing jobs being eliminated during the NAFTA decade.2 U.S. income and wage inequality have gone up markedly, with the ratio of both income and wages of the top five percent of the income and wage distribution growing nearly 10 percent since NAFTA alone as compared with the bottom 20 percent.3 The U.S. real median wage has scarcely risen above its 1970 level, resulting in declining or stagnant standards of living for the nearly 70 percent of the U.S. population that does not have a college degree.4 During the NAFTA era, the U.S. trade deficit has risen to historic levels, and approaches six percent of national income—a figure widely agreed to be unsustainable, putting the U.S. economy at risk of lowered income growth.5 The U.S. trade balance with NAFTA countries alone went from a mild surplus with Mexico and mild deficit with Canada to a ballooning deficit with the two countries exceeding $110 billion in 2004.6
    __label__nonrel;  For our neighbors in Mexico, the economic outcomes of eleven years of NAFTA are not brighter. Over 1 5 million Mexican campesino farmers lost their livelihoods to the dumping of commodities such as corn as a result of NAFTA's agricultural rules,7 while the Mexican minimum wage has lost 20 percent of its value in real terms, and the median industrial wage 10 percent of its value8 The jobs that were temporarily created in the country's maquiladora sector in NAFTA's initial years, as plants relocated from the United States, are increasingly relocating and losing market share to lower wage countries such as China.9
    __label__nonrel;  In both countries, the increased ability of companies to nearly effortlessly relocate production to lower wage countries—(as NAFTA's investor protections forbid the policies a country like Mexico might otherwise use to root foreign direct investment for development)—has tilted the playing field against the majority of the working
   __label__fdi __label__dispute;  2. Contradicting Congress' Demand that Trade Pacts Give Foreign Investors "No Greater Rights" within the U.S. than Available to U.S. Citizens, CAFTA Extends NAFTA's Special Protections for Foreign Investors that Expose U.S. Taxpayer Funds to Claims in Closed Trade Tribunals
   __label__laborrights __label__enforcement __label__dispute __label__fdi;  The changes described above in the NAFTA country labor markets are supported by the granting in NAFTA and CAFTA of special rights and privileges to foreign investors from one signatory country operating in another. In NAFTA, these rights are contained in Chapter 11, which also provides for foreign investors' private enforcement of these new privileges through so-called investor-state dispute resolution, a controversial mechanism also included in CAFTA. The investor-state system allows corporations to sue governments for cash compensation before closed trade tribunals for claims based on signatory countries' policies that may or may not have a demonstrable economic impact on their expected future earnings. The provisions afford foreign investors operating in the United States greater rights than those available to U.S. citizens and businesses under the U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. Thus far, 42 cases have been brought before the NAFTA investor-state tribunals, 11 have been finalized, and some $35 million in taxpayer funds have been granted to five corporations that have succeeded with their claims. An additional $28 billion has been claimed from investors in all three NAFTA nations in cases attacking the most basic functions of government. The U.S. government's legal costs for the defense of just such recent case topped $3 million, and seven cases against the United States are currently in active arbitration.
   __label__dispute __label__fdi;  While ostensibly, NAFTA's investor protections were designed to ensure compensation if property is nationalized by a NAFTA government, only one of the 42 known NAFTA "Chapter 11" cases filed to date involve expropriation. Instead, investors have challenged domestic court rulings, water rights, local and state environmental policies, municipal contracts, tax policy, controlled substances rules, anti-gambling policies, emergency efforts to halt the spread of mad cow disease, and even provision of public postal services.
   __label__nonrel;  Given that these extraordinary investor rights and their private enforcement had not been part of any previous U.S. trade agreement, and that many Members of Congress did not understand these implications at the time when NAFTA was enacted in 1993, the record of NAFTA's Chapter 11 has generated enormous controversy. Thus in order to obtain a congressional delegation of Fast Track Trade Authority in 2002, the Administration offered to address Congress' concerns. Fast Track thus specified that in future U.S. trade agreements, foreign investors should not have "greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than United States investors in the United States."11
   __label__fdi;  Unfortunately, the Executive Branch negotiators failed to meet Congress' requirements. In CAFTA's Chapter 10 foreign investor protections and investor-state mechanism actually amplify many of the problems Congress identified with NAFTA.
   __label__fdi;  * CAFTA Would Allow Compensation to Foreign Investors in "Regulatory Takings" and "Minimum Standard of Treatment" Cases not Permitted by U.S. Law: CAFTA includes the NAFTA language that requires foreign investors be compensated for "indirect expropriation." This provision has been the basis for an array of cases that would not be permitted under U.S. law, including regulatory takings cases. In one such case, Metalclad Corporation obtained $16 million from the Mexican Treasury after being denied a permit to expand a toxic waste facility until it cleaned up existing contamination.12 Several additional CAFTA provisions promote regulatory takings cases not allowed under U.S. law. For instance, the Supreme Court has ruled that "mere diminution in the value of property, however serious, is insufficient to demonstrate a tak-
   __label__fdi;  To make matters worse, CAFTA allows such claims regarding types of property not subject to takings action under U.S. law. U.S. law deems public interest policies governing personal property (property other than land) to be legitimate exercises of police powers and exempt from takings claims. In contrast, CAFTA's broad definition of what categories of property are subject to compensation claims includes an array of non-real estate property such as assumption of risk and also bonds, loans, stocks, and intellectual property rights.
   __label__fdi;  In response to criticism that investment rules in CAFTA allow for broad regulatory takings claims, the USTR will likely point to CAFTA, Annex 10–C, which reads: "Except in rare circumstances, nondiscriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations." 16 Unfortunately, this language has precisely the opposite effect claimed. This language enshrines the right of foreign investors to challenge a wide array of public health and safety regulations not be subject to U.S. taking claims. U.S. law safeguards all public interest regulations governing personal property, yet this language reiterates that such policies are subject to CAFTA challenge. Moreover, the U.S. government would have no capacity to affect whether such cases are brought only in "rare" circumstances. Foreign investors decide whether to file these cases. (And, the U.S. legal defense cost for just one such case, Methenex's attack on California's ban on the gasoline additive MTBE, has already cost $3 million in U.S. taxpayer funds.) Further, the ultimate decision whether or not to grant compensation in such challenges remains with investor-state tribunals on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, when deciding such cases, tribunals will reference other specific provisions of CAFTA that directly conflicts with the Annex's general language. There have been numerous NAFTA cases involving toxic substances, including Phillip Morris' threat against a proposed Canadian tobacco control law, and Canadian cattlemen's NAFTA challenge of U.S. actions to prevent entry into the U.S. of mad cow disease. To avoid future such cases and to bring CAFTA into conformity with U.S. takings law, the scope of property subject to such claims in CAFTA needed to have been limited to real estate and the "indirect expropriation" language needed to have been eliminated, or at least defined in the context of U.S. takings standards that require that virtually all of a property's value must be taken permanently to obtain compensation.
 __label__fdi __label__dispute;  * CAFTA Would Allow Compensation to Foreign Investors in Cases in which U.S. Law Only Permits Injunctive Relief: Under U.S. law, both foreign and domestic firms can sue under the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution for injunctive relief, but they are not allowed to sue for monetary relief. Under NAFTA's investment rules—and under CAFTA were it to be approved—foreign investors are empowered to sue for monetary relief on similar grounds. CAFTA extends this NAFTA problem by allowing foreign

The Metalclad panel stated that expropriation under NAFTA "includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favor of the host state, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner in whole or in significant part of the reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of the property."

 __label__environment __label__fdi;  * CAFTA Would Eviscerate the Long-established Principle that Governments Can Remedy a "Nuisance" without Compensating Polluters: The expansive definition in CAFTA of what sorts of foreign investments are subject to compensation covers government actions to prevent a public nuisance. Given the record of the related NAFTA provisions, this element of CAFTA is likely to generate further claims by chemical companies attempting to combat environmental regulation. Under NAFTA, foreign investors are demanding compensation for California's ban of the gasoline additive MTBE which has been found to be polluting scarce water resources in the state and for California's open pit mining reclamation law. Yet, under the U.S. Supreme Court holding in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, pollution that harms public or other properties is a nuisance that can be regulated by states without compensation.17 USTR failed to remedy this problem in CAFTA.
 __label__fdi __label__dispute;  * CAFTA Would Empower Foreign Investors to Overcome the Long-established Sovereign Immunity Shield to Pursue U.S. Taxpayer Compensation In Property Claims from which U.S. Residents and Companies Are Barred: NAFTA panels have explicitly refused to dismiss investor challenges when governments have raised sovereign immunity as a defense in investor-state challenges—apparently allowing firms to sue governments at any level regarding any issue for any amount of money. Indeed, in these cases, investor-state tribunals have accepted the argument raised by some foreign investors that Congress waived federal sovereign immunity when it passed NAFTA. USTR failed to remedy this problem in CAFTA with explicit language clarifying that sovereign immunity was not waived, thus providing an open door for future such challenges.
    __label__fdi __label__environment __label__govprocure;  3. CAFTA Would Forbid Congressional, States' Anti-Offshoring Policies that Require Government Contract Work be Done by U.S. Workers; Forbids Environmental, Other Procurement Rules
    __label__govprocure __label__environment;  CAFTA's rules on government procurement apply to an array of federal government agencies as well as the states that are listed as "covered entities" in Chapter 9, Annex 9.12 (b) (i). In September 2003, the United States Trade Representative sent a letter to all 50 governors, requesting that they commit their states to be bound by the procurement provisions in all bilateral and regional trade pacts under negotiation, including CAFTA. The letter touted the potential for U.S. suppliers to bid on foreign government contracts, but failed to mention the requirements the procurement chapters CAFTA and other agreements imposed on states. Initially, twenty eight states were listed as bound in the CAFTA text. However, since then, state officials have become much more aware of the implications that binding state procurement policy to CAFTA's rules would have on their ability to determine what procurement policies are in the best interests of the state, including policies that use state purchasing power to further social, environmental, and economic development goals.
    __label__govprocure;  As a result, a majority of U.S. states (30) have rejected CAFTA's government procurement rules and decided it is not in their best interest to be bound. In 2004, seven governors (from Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, and Pennsylvania) rescinded their previous commitments on behalf of their states to be bound to CAFTA's procurement rules. Other states (Montana, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Virginia) declined the USTR's request outright. Governors of states that remain bound by CAFTA, including Texas and Washington, have requested that additional reservations be taken. (Only some of those requests have been incorporated into the CAFTA text. Washington's request was rejected in an August 13, 2004 letter from Ambassador Zoellick to Washington Governor Gary Locke.) In early 2005, the National Conference of State Legislatures wrote to the USTR, requesting that the USTR respond to the myriad concerns of state legislators. The Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee (IGPAC) issued recommendations in August 2004 that state legislative leaders be carbon copied on all requests sent to governors, as state legislators to date have been cut out of the consultation process, despite the fact that in most states, the Legislative Branch has the authority to set state procurement policy. The USTR explicitly denied that request, and sent another letter to governors requesting that they sign on to the procurement provisions of free trade agreements with Panama and Andean countries. Most recently, in April 2005, the
   __label__govprocure;  State officials' concerns stem from the restrictions that CAFTA's rules impose on their ability to maintain existing and adopt new procurement policies in the public interest. CAFTA's procurement chapter prohibits many common purchasing policies, seriously weakening governments' flexibility to use procurement as policy tool to promote economic development, environmental sustainability, and human rights. These rules also apply to federal government procurement policies:
 __label__govprocure;  * Requirements that Government Work Be Performed in the United States by -U.S. Workers Are Prohibited: If CAFTA were approved, federal and state governments would be required to treat companies located in the six CAFTA countries identically to U.S. domestic companies when governments seek to procure goods and services. This means neither Congress nor state governments could give preference to domestic or local firms or require that to obtain government contracts, firms must employ U.S. workers (CAFTA Article 9.2).
 __label__environment __label__laborrights;  * Sweat-Free, Recycled Content, Renewable Source and Other Labor and Environmental Criteria Banned: CAFTA requires that "a procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical specification describing a good or service with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to trade" and that technical specifications are limited to "performance requirements rather than design or descriptive characteristics." These constraints mean that procurement policies that set criteria for how a good is made or how a service is provided are prohibited—putting preferences for recycled content or renewable energy, "green" building requirements, and bans on goods made with the worst forms of child or slave labor at risk as "barriers to trade" (CAFTA Article 9.7).
 __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__humanrights;  * Consideration of Bidding Firms' Labor, Tax, Environmental, Human Rights Records Forbidden: CAFTA limits what sorts of qualifications may be required of companies seeking to supply a good or service to a government. Conditions for participation in bidding are limited to "those that are essential to ensure that the supplier has the legal, technical and financial abilities to fulfill the requirements and technical specifications of the procurement." CAFTA's limits on the requirements that can be imposed on contractors prohibit conditions such as prevailing wage and living wage requirements, as well as consideration of suppliers' environmental or labor track records (CAFTA Article 9.8).
   __label__mobilization;  4. Opposition to CAFTA NAFTA Expansion Wide and Varied, Having Grown Since NAFTA
   __label__mobilization;  As successive Administrations have failed to reverse the damage and demonstrated, significant problems of NAFTA's foreign investor protection model, opposition has grown in all quarters. The Association of State Supreme Court Justices, U.S. League of Cities, National Conference of State Legislatures, National Association of Counties, and National Association of Towns and Townships all have expressed concerns about the investment provisions of CAFTA.
   __label__mobilization;  Concerns about CAFTA's foreign investor protection by these typically pro 'free trade' associations of state and local officials, groups that are concerned about our nation's system of federalism and the integrity of our domestic courts, has been joined by outright opposition to CAFTA from other unexpected quarters, suggesting the degree to which this agreement signed a year ago is seen not to serve the U.S. national interest. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, for one, concerned about CAFTA's agricultural provisions called on Congress to oppose CAFTA.18 These and other agricultural groups are concerned about declining farm revenue even as volumes of food trade increased under NAFTA, and that the United States is about to become a net food importer. Furthermore, these groups take to heart the claims of pro-CAFTA forces, who continually repeat that CAFTA is a stepping stone to a proposed broader Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).19 Many U.S. economic sectors views of CAFTA are tied to their analysis of how competition with Brazil in a NAFTA expansion from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego would affect their export capacity in beef, soy, citrus, sugar and ethanol.
   __label__mobilization __label__humanrights __label__environment __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  Many other groups have also expressed opposition to CAFTA NAFTA expansion. Human Rights Watch has produced analyses of the failure of Central American
   __label__mobilization;  And U.S. Latino organizations who supported NAFTA, from the nation's largest and oldest Hispanic civil rights organization the League of United Latin American Citizens to an array of immigrant rights groups representing Central Americans in the United States, have also indicated their opposition the current terms of the agreement, concerned that trade-related job loss disproportionately affects U.S. Latinos and that CAFTA's negative repercussions for Central America are foretold by NAFTA's negative results in Mexico.22
   __label__mobilization;  Lawmakers concerned about the implications of the so-called "Arab Street" in the Middle East should also pay attention to the passionate CAFTA opposition on the "Latin Street" of Central America. Nearly one out of every 25 El Salvadorans have publicly rallied against CAFTA in the past several years, and polls indicate that a majority of citizens in Guatemala and elsewhere oppose the terms of CAFTA.23 In Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua, massive protests have also occurred against CAFTA, while it is unclear if Costa Rica's congress will approve the dea1.24
   __label__process;  Officials from the U.S. Trade Representative's office have taken to threatening Costa Rica that if the democratically-elected Congress there determines the pact is not in their nation's interest and rejects it, the United States will remove that nation's existing terms of access to the U.S. market provided under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). These threats continue today despite the March 2005 letter by Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Charles Rangel (D–NY) calling upon the Administration to desist these misleading pronouncements. As Rep. Ran-gel's letter pointed out, CBI is a "congressionally mandated program [whose] benefits are guaranteed on a permanent basis, unless the Congress amends current U.S. law." The representative said he would oppose such an amendement of U.S. law, characterizing the Administration's remarks as "thinly veiled blackmail." 25
   __label__mobilization;  Regardless of the Administration's bullying and disrespectful treatment of some CAFTA countries, certainly Congress would be concerned with the underlying cause of such passionate opposition to CAFTA in Central America—opposition whose protests have been met with increasing violence by governments. This includes the murder by military troops in Guatemala of two Mayan protestors—an act of military violence by the army explicitly forbidden in the 1996 peace accords.26
   __label__fdi __label__mobilization __label__process;  The causes of opposition include CAFTA's service sector rules, which would require these nations to privatize and deregulate numerous essential services such as energy and other utilities, health care and more, as well as foreign investor protections, which would create a new set of rights for foreign investors to acquire ownership over natural resources and land and pharmaceutical patent requirements, including extended data exclusion terms, which would hurt poor people's access to medicines and take Central American governments' abilities to respond to public health crises such as HIV–AIDS. Fury about these severe threats has been exacerbated by the Administration's heavy handed tactics, for instance in pressuring Gua-
    __label__mobilization;  Now major Central American political parties, Catholic bishops, the Central American Council of Churches and other mainstream, important Central American interests have come out against CAFTA as a threat to the region. In addition, eighteen of the most democratic, independent and representative union federations throughout Central America representing workers in the private and public sector, including in export-oriented manufacturing and agriculture, have demanded stronger workers rights than those provided under CAFTA.28 They have noted that the existing CBI arrangement affords concerned citizens with the International Labor Organization core rights and with the greater ability to improve Central American labor law than the proposed CAFTA's roll-back CBI labor provisions.
    __label__exports __label__impcomp;  Given this broadscale U.S. and Central American opposition to a NAFTA expansion, pro-CAFTA forces have increasingly resorted to disconnected arguments and exaggerated and misrepresentative claims about the agreement. For instance, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has produced a flawed study projecting U.S. economic gains from a Central America agreement. But to obtain that conclusion, the Chamber had to assume that—contrary to the history of every trade agreement the United States has signed—the United States would receive no new imports from the CAFTA countries if the pact went into effect.29 The study's methodology additionally implies that over 80 percent of the Honduran economy would have to absorbed by U.S. exports by 2013, a potentially socially and economically destabilizing outcome if true.3°
    __label__development;  Despite this projection that Central American countries would not gain from a CAFTA, pro-CAFTA forces have simultaneously asserted that CAFTA would save the U.S. and Central American textile industries from the end of the global textile and apparel quota system.31 Here too, their claims are wildly misleading, since experts from the U.S. International Trade Commission to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have demonstrated that China enjoys a significant technological, wage and input cost advantage over the Central American countries. This means that, with or without a CAFTA, the expiration of the Multi Fiber Arrangement quota system will result in Central America losing a great deal of its current production and employment in the textile and apparel industry.
    __label__rulesoforig;  The notion that CAFTA would affect this situation is beyond bizarre. Already under CBI, CAFTA countries' textile and apparel exports enter the United States duty free. CAFTA provides no additional benefit for entry. Indeed, CAFTA loosens the CBI rules of origin, meaning more Chinese goods could enter through CAFTA countries if CAFTA were implemented than are now permitted.
    __label__nonrel;  Already, apparel imports from China jumped amount in the first quarter, and by as much as 1,521 percent in some customs categories.32 While Congress may seek to address this flood of cheap Chinese imports, this is a separate problem than CAFTA and would require a separate solution. The debate around CAFTA is not a question of "whether U.S. workers would rather lose their jobs to China or to Central America," as Carlos Sequeira, Nicaragua's chief CAFTA negotiator put it.33 Congress should instead focus on the flaws of CAFTA, which would loosen CBI's requirement that U.S. inputs be used to enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market and undermine CBI's labor rights protections, while still not proffering to the dying Central American industry any access benefits that they do not already enjoy through CBI.
    __label__outro;  The bottomline in Congress' consideration of CAFTA should be whether extending the NAFTA model will help us create a brighter future for our children and grand-
    __label__outro __label__position;  As a group that works with consumer organizations around the world, we would urge Congress to oppose this agreement simply on the basis of its intellectual property rules which are certain to undermine affordable access to essential medicines for poor consumers in the Central America. Many other organizations are submitted testimony about these scandalous provisions of CAFTA NAFTA expansion. At issue are life or death matters: generic versions of the cocktail of anti-retroviral drugs essential to extending the lives of those infected with HIV cost several hundred dollars for a yearlong course while the brand name patented version of the same drugs cost $5,000 per year. If the CAFTA drug patent rules would go into effect in the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, many people now able to have access to these life saving HIV–AIDS medicines and also drugs vital to fighting tuberculosis and other deseases will not have access to these medicines—either because they cannot afford to purchase them or because their government health agencies cannot afford them to provide to their public.
    __label__outro;  Thus given CAFTA NAFTA expansion's potential extension of the failures of NAFTA to people in six additional nations and the damage to U.S. residents that further extension of this model would pose, we urge Congress to oppose NAFTA's expansion to Central America and beyond.
    __label__intro __label__position;  On behalf of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, we welcome the opportunity to submit written comments for the record for this important hearing on the United States-Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR–CAFTA), now coming before the Congress for implementation. We strongly support the DRCAFTA agreement and urge swift Congressional passage of the implementing legislation.
    __label__growth __label__security;  By way of background, the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) represents the nation's most successful and innovative retailer and supplier companies—the leaders of the retail industry. (As a sector, retail is the second largest industry in the U.S., employing 12 percent of the nation's total workforce and conducting $3.8 trillion in annual sales. RILA's retail and product supplier companies operate 100,000 stores, manufacturing facilities and distribution centers in every congressional district in every state, as well as internationally. They pay billions in federal, state and local taxes and collect and remit billions more in sales taxes. They are also leading corporate citizens with some of the nation's most far-reaching community outreach and corporate social responsibility initiatives.
    __label__exports;  Central America and the Dominican Republic make up the second-largest U.S. export market in Latin America, behind only Mexico. U.S. sales in the region exceed $15 billion annually—more than is sold toRussia, India and Indonesia combined—a result achieved in the absence of reciprocal trade liberalization. Upon full implementation of the agreement, U.S. goods will be able to enter the participating countries duty free. In fact, 80% of the commercial goods will become duty free once the agreement is implemented, with the rest phased out over a ten-year period. This will help to significantly increase U.S. exports of farm products, manufactured goods and services to the region. According to a report by the International Trade Commission on the economic impact of the agreement, once the agreement is fully implemented, exports will grow by nearly $2.7 billion.
   __label__exports __label__consumers;  In addition to increased benefits for U.S. exporters, U.S. importers and their customers will benefit from implementation of the DR–CAFTA as well. Most Central American products already enter the United States duty-free, under preference programs such as the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA). Enshrining this treatment in an international agreement with reciprocal obligations will provide added commercial security as well as a firmer legal basis under WTO rules. This aspect of the FTA is in effect a tax cut targeted to those consumers who need it most.
   __label__security __label__immigration;  Within recent memory, conditions in Central America have featured civil war, chaos, dictators, and Communist insurgencies. Today, the region is one of fragile democracies that need U.S. support. Elected leaders are embracing freedom and economic reform, fighting corruption, and supporting U.S. anti-narcotics and anti-terrorism efforts. But this positive momentum cannot be taken for granted. Opponents of reform in the region remain strong. By implementing the DR–CAFTA, the United States can demonstrate its support for freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and economic reform in Central America. Doing so will bolster U.S. security in various ways. The new economic opportunities will reduce the pressures that help produce illegal narcotics activity and illegal immigration.
   __label__laborrights __label__sourcing;  America's retailers are committed to careful supply chain management and high ethical standards of corporate conduct in international sourcing. This applies to products sourced in notjust in Central America, but around the world. Our experience with the DR–CAFTA countries has shown that they share these values and high standards, including the field of labor rights. Their constitutions and national laws generally provide strong labor protections consistent with the International Labor Organization's four "core principles." Indeed, labor protections in these countries are largely in line with those in Morocco and Jordan, whose accession to the status of "FTA partner" gained overwhelming Congressional approval in recent years.
   __label__laborrights __label__development __label__dispute;  The DR–CAFTA will promote economic opportunities and growth that are likely to become powerful catalysts for improved working conditions in the region. Through capacity-building and dispute settlement, the DR–CAFTA will also address those circumstances where better enforcement of existing labor laws proves necessary.
   __label__rulesoforig __label__forbarriersred;  The textile and apparel product category is a hugely important component of U.S.Central American trade, and retailers are committed to finding the best available combination of speed-to-market, product price, and quality of products for their consumers. U.S. consumers will benefit from several innovative DR–CAFTA provisions promoted by retailers to add needed flexibility to the outdated "yarn forward" rule of origin. Moreover, qualifying textile and apparel products are to be afforded immediate U.S. duty free treatment.
   __label__jobs;  Retailers are also quite interested in the health of regional textile and apparel producers—our valued suppliers. The DR–CAFTA is strategically designed to improve their competitive situation at a time when, following the expiration of global textile and apparel quotas, they face a formidable challenge from outside the hemisphere, most notably China. The DR–CAFTA will provide regional garment-makers—and their U.S. suppliers of fabric, yarn and other components—a boost in competing with Asian producers and will support an estimated 400,000 jobs in the DRCAFTA countries and 700,000 jobs in the U.S. cotton, yarn, textile and apparel sectors.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__alltrade __label__fdi __label__sourcing;  In addition to benefits for textiles and apparel, there are significant benefits for footwear imports in the DR–CAFTA. A solid consensus in all segments of footwear manufacturing and retailing favors immediate duty-free treatment for footwear traded among the DR–CAFTA countries, excluding a few import-sensitive tariff lines. By delivering this outcome, the DR–CAFTA lays the groundwork for increased trade and investment in the footwear sector, supports retailer strategies designed to maintain geographically diverse sourcing options, provides substantial benefits to consumers, and poses no risk to U.S. footwear production.
    __label__nonrel;  For the first time in a trade agreement, the DR—CAFTA addresses restrictions on distribution created through restrictive dealer protection regimes. Such regimes are prevalent in Central America today and have locked U.S. companies and products into inefficient, exclusive and effectively permanent relationships with local dealers regardless of performance. DR—CAFTA rules would require dealer distribution agreements to permit parties to terminate at the end of the contract or renewal period without indemnification. These rules will promote more efficient distribution for U.S. companies and products in the DR—CAFTA region.
    __label__rulesoforig __label__forbarriersred;  No FTA is perfect, and as with other FTAs, experience under the DR—CAFTA may reveal opportunities for useful adjustments in areas like rules of origin, accelerated tariff phase-out, etc. Some improvements may require the negotiated approval of all the DR—CAFTA parties; others may be of the type the United States can make unilaterally. The implementing legislation should establish a flexible and streamlined framework for making such adjustments over time, using available tools such as proclamation authority and consultation/layover.
    __label__outro __label__position;  RILA congratulates the Ways and Means Committee for turning its attention to this important agreement, and stands ready to assist as the implementation process moves forward. If you have any questions, please contact Lori Denham, Senior Vice President Policy and Planning or Jonathan Gold, Vice President Global Supply Chain Policy.
    __label__intro __label__position;  Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to offer my concerns regarding this important issue. I strongly oppose the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR—CAFTA).
    __label__intro;  DR—CAFTA is largely based on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). By signing DR—CAFTA, the Bush Administration has ignored the mistakes of NAFTA. Ten years ago, NAFTA proponents promised increased wages and economic development in the United States, Mexico, and Canada and decreased migration. The agreement has failed on all accounts.
    __label__jobs __label__laborrights;  As in Mexico with NAFTA, DR—CAFTA would cause the loss of family farms and lure more workers, most of them women. DR—CAFTA may create jobs of women, but the working conditions are unimaginable to the American public. The bulk of these jobs are in the Export-Processing Zones, also known as maquiladoras.
    __label__nonrel;  I have visited Mexico and seen firsthand the devastating consequences of NAFTA. In the maquiladora zone in Ciudad Juarez and other border cities, wages are low, union organizing is suppressed, and industrial pollution jeopardizes the health of workers and residents.
    __label__nonrel;  Women that work in the maquiladoras have reported forced pregnancy testing, sexual harassment, and physical abuse. DR—CAFTA does not require compliance with international labor rights and does not protect women from discrimination. Inadequate free trade agreements, such as NAFTA, not only hurt our women workers, but also hurt American workers.
    __label__jobs;  Over 750,000 jobs in the United States have been lost due to NAFTA and immigration to the United States has only increased. DR—CAFTA will mean more job loss and wage decline for American workers. U.S. Latino workers have been disproportionately hurt by NAFTA because they tend to be concentrated in industries such as textiles and other manufacturing sectors.
    __label__nonrel;  While Latinos represent 12.6% of the total U.S. workforce, they account for 26% of textile and apparel industry workers. In California, Latinos make up an estimated 80% of the California garment industry, which has been especially hard-hit by NAFTA's impact. As a result, Latino workers have been significantly hurt by NAFTA. According to the Department of Labor, 47% of individuals that applied for NAFTA's Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program due to lay offs were Latino.
    __label__nonrel;  Americans believe that we should NOT peruse future free trade agreements similar to NAFTA. In fact, the League of United Latin American Citizens, LULAC, the oldest and largest Latino organization in the U.S. publicly opposes DR—CAFTA. LULAC claims that DR—CAFTA "falls short of being acceptable" and fear that CAFTA will unleash enormous loses for all workers, in the U.S. and Central America.
   __label__position;  As the only Member of Congress of Central American descent, I understand the importance of supporting efforts to promote sustainable development and preservation of the agricultural sector in that region. However, U.S. policy towards Latin America should go beyond free trade policies that do little to raise wages and working conditions for the poor.
   __label__outro;  Those who oppose DR—CAFTA do so because of the irreparable harm it will have to the economy and workers of Central America and the United States. We can not allow the failures of NAFTA be reproduced through DR—CAFTA.
    __label__intro __label__position;  On May 28, 2004, the United States and the Central American countries (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) signed the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in the Hall of Americas in the Organization of American States. Upon signing the agreement, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick suggested that "CAFTA will put the U.S. relationship with Central America on a more solid, mutual foundation, firmly grounded in our shared commitment to democracy, free markets, free people, and hope." The Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), however, is deeply concerned that DR—CAFTA will only result in free markets without the anticipated freedom and hope for the millions of people in the region. In particular, WOLA believes that DR—CAFTA's provisions on agriculture, labor and intellectual property will frustrate, rather than promote development in the region. WOLA therefore urges all members of congress to reject DR—CAFTA.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__dumping __label__jobs __label__poverty __label__exports;  DR—CAFTA's likely impact on the Central American rural sector is a cause for concern. Under the agreement, the Central American countries will eliminate over time tariffs on basic grains, such as rice, beans and corn, products on which the lives of millions of people now depend. With ever-greater access to the Central American market, U.S. agro-export corporations, which produce and export grains at artificially low prices due to government supports, will undercut their Central American counterparts, mostly small and family farmers. Dumping cheaper, subsidized grains into the Central American market could lead to a significant loss of agricultural jobs, creating greater poverty, hunger and rural emigration. Indeed, a 2004 U.S. International Trade Commission report on DR—CAFTA projects that Central America will significantly increase imports of basic grains upon implementation of the agreement.1 In a region where roughly half of all employment is in agriculture, this will have devastating long-term effects.
    __label__nonrel;  Agriculture still remains the largest source of employment in many Central American countries. In Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, agriculture still remains the largest source of employment, engaging 52.5, 43.9 and 43.2% of the economically active population respectively. In the U.S., by comparison, only 2% of the labor force is employed in the rural sector. In addition, the region is dependent on a few, key export crops, which are highly vulnerable to the volatility of international markets. In Central America, poverty is concentrated in the rural sector. According to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, 64% of Latin America's rural population lives in poverty, compared to 59.9% in 1980. Official support for the rural sector has also declined significantly over the last two decades, and structural adjustment programs in the 1980s and '90s have resulted in minimal investment in rural infrastructure, financial services and human capital in the region. Not only has productivity of Central American farms suffered as a result, but lack of overall employment opportunities has been the impetus of outward migration to the U.S.
   __label__process;  The U.S. steadfastly refused to discuss the issue of subsidies to its own agricultural producers, preferring to discuss this issue at the level of the WTO. In response, the Central American negotiators and producer federations demanded that sensitive agricultural crops such as basic grains, dairy and pork be exempt from the negotiations until the U.S. eliminates its unfair agricultural subsidies. Again, the U.S. refused any exemptions for these products. This forced the Central American governments to offer a weaker proposal for special and differential treatment; they called for increased market access for some products and the maintenance of high tariffs and longer liberalization periods for sensitive agricultural products. Once again, the U.S. refused.
    __label__nonrel;  According to the Mesoamerican Initiative for Trade Integration, Central Americans conceded much more than they received in agriculture. By the end of the negotiations, the four remaining Central American countries received a small amount of new market access for certain products such as sugar, and a 15 to 20 year liberalization period for several sensitive crops. Farmers, analysts and government negotiators alike recognize that these are very small gains, compared to the blows the agricultural sector will sustain under CAFTA. On December 31, 2003 the lead Guatemalan Negotiator Guido Rodas, stated, "Rice, pork, corn, beer, telecommunications and generic medicines are among the losers who will pick up the tab of the CAFTA negotiation."
    __label__nonrel;  Some proponents of CAFTA have argued that small-scale farming in Central America is a dying industry, and that subsistence farmers are becoming obsolete in the global economy. However, far from obsolescence, small and medium-scale agriculture plays multiple, important roles in Central America. Small and medium farms create significant rural employment, with backward and forward linkages in the rural economy. Local food production is also important for food security and nutrition. Small farmers play an important role as environmental stewards, caring for the land, just as agriculture plays an important cultural and historical role in the social fabric of Central America. Finally, rural development and opportunities in agriculture help to decrease migratory pressure on cities and the U.S.
    __label__smallbiz __label__jobs;  It has been said that trade agreements create winners and losers; there are people who benefit from trade liberalization, and those who do not. NAFTA has demonstrated, as will DR–CAFTA if it passes, that the biggest losers in these trade deals are in the agricultural sector, especially small and medium farmers and day laborers. The experience of NAFTA in the Mexican agricultural sector is illustrative. At least 1.5 million Mexican farmers lost their livelihoods to NAFTA. According to a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report published in 2004, approximately 8 million of Mexico's active labor force worked in the agriculture sector in 1993; by 2003, it was roughly 6.5 million The report states, "Agricultural trade liberalization linked to NAFTA is the signal most significant factor in the loss of agricultural jobs in Mexico." Similarly, a recent report by Oxfam International, entitled "A Raw Deal for Rice," predicts that 1 5 million jobs directly and indirectly related to the rice sector could be lost upon full implementation of DR–CAFTA.
    __label__exports;  As proponents of NAFTA then argued, displaced farmers will simply move to new industries, but job creation—particularly in the export processing sector—is being eroded as jobs move to new markets in Asia. The situation is even worse now with the expiation of the Multi-Fiber Agreement. Without quotas, many small and medium sized producers are likely to close. A 2004 report issued by U.S. AID on the garment industry in the Dominican Republic, for example, projects that the garment exports to the U.S. will decrease by 25% even after DR–CAFTA is implemented. Although the impact of the phase-out is expected to be softened slightly by CAFTA, the agreement is by no means a salvation.
    __label__jobs __label__immigration __label__poverty;  Congress must view trade agreements and the impact of trade through the lens of poverty reduction, and measure the agreements by the extent to which people are able to exercise their economic and social rights. Trade is an important factor in any economy, but, as studies such as the Carnegie report demonstrate, agricultural liberalization is not good for developing countries that have huge trade asymmetries vis-&-vis their trading partners. Like their Mexican counterparts, Central American farmers will be unable to compete against highly subsidized production in the U.S. and elsewhere in the developed world. This will result in increased poverty, greater levels of rural unemployment and more migration—further violating Central Americans economic and social rights. Simply put, CAFTA is not the development strategy that the region needs.
    __label__nonrel;  The labor laws of the Central American countries fail in many respects to meet the minimum standards set forth in international instruments such as the ILO's Fundamental Declaration of Rights at Work. Moreover, enforcement of labor rights is seriously deficient. In some cases, for example, labor ministry personnel encourage or participate in employer abuses of workers' rights by acting upon illegal requests that harm workers. In other cases, labor ministry officials use obstructionist tactics to avoid granting recognition to unions. The action or inaction of labor courts also deny workers their rights, as long delays in court proceedings, at times due to judicial collusion with employers or simple incompetence, and non-enforcement of court orders result in the effective denial of justice to workers
     __label__position __label__humanrights __label__laborrights;  The situation of impunity with regard to workers' exercise of freedom of association and collective bargaining is a serious problem that undermines the rule of law and the prospects for social and economic justice throughout Central America. This situation can only be addressed by policies that promote democratic, equitable, and sustainable development, based on respect for fundamental labor and human rights. As explained below, the CAFTA does not contain adequate mechanisms that encourage positive labor law reform or, indeed, discourage retrenchments in existing laws. Indeed, the labor chapter does little to even ensure that existing laws are adequately enforced. Because the CAFTA will not encourage social and economic development, as it does not adequately promote respect for the fundamental human rights of the people of Central America, CAFTA must be opposed.
     __label__laborrights;  At a February 9, 2005 conference hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), former U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor rejected the DR—CAFTA for its lack of an adequate, enforceable labor clause. "I think it should go back to negotiating table," said Kantor, who found several shortcomings with the labor clauses negotiated in various free trade agreements by the current USTR. Upon reading Chapter 16, the labor chapter, and with an understanding of the labor laws of the region, it is obvious why Mr. Kantor concluded that the DRCAFTA as "a major step backwards on this issue."
     __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  Under Chapter 16, member states are under absolutely no obligation to meet the core labor standards articulated by the International Labor Organization (ILO), or the international worker rights standards incorporated into previous, unilateral U.S. trade laws. Rather, member states have committed only to "strive to ensure" that these principles are protected by local law. Incredibly, member states do not have to strive to eliminate discrimination in employment, as that right is explicitly beyond the scope of the agreement. Thus, only a "fail[ure] to effective enforce ll labor laws, through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction, in a manner effecting trade between the Parties" could ever subject a country to a fine. Even then, Article 16.2(a) excuses the action or inaction of member state if it is deemed "a reasonable exercise of discretion" or a "bona fide decision regarding the allocation of resources." Thus, the negative "failure to enforce" standard may be denied any force of law if a member state can satisfy the ambiguous test of "reasonableness" or show that their under-funded Ministries of Labor allocated resources toward some other reasonable objective.
     __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  Because local labor laws in many respects fall short of international minimum standards, the CAFTA language does nothing more than requires that existing, inadequate practices be continued. Moreover, a member state is under no enforceable obligation to maintain those inadequate laws and could weaken those laws further to gain an unfair trade advantage. As such, a country may violate international labor law and continue to enjoy all of the market access benefits of the trade agreement. The procedures and remedies for addressing violations that do exist under CAFTA are completely also inadequate. The labor enforcement procedures cap the maximum amount of fines and sanctions available at an unacceptably low level, and allow violators to pay fines to themselves with little oversight. These provisions not only make the labor chapter's one limited obligation virtually unenforceable, they also differ dramatically from the enforcement procedures and remedies available for commercial disputes.
     __label__laborrights __label__enforcement __label__dispute;  The texts of previous free trade agreements demonstrate that the USTR is capable of negotiating a more rigorous labor clause when it so decides. The labor clause negotiated in the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement is one such example. The USTR's "fact sheets" aside, the U.S.-Jordan Agreement is far superior to DRCAFTA on the issue of labor rights. Under U.S.-Jordan, all labor right obligations, not simply the obligation to enforce domestic laws, may be brought under the dispute resolution and enforcement mechanisms. For example, a claim that a state party relaxed its laws to attract trade or that it failed to ensure that its domestic laws provided protections consistent with international labor standards could be brought under Jordan, but not DR—CAFTA. This is a critical distinction. Moreover, the dispute resolution mechanism in U.S.-Jordan is the same as the commercial mechanism; the same is not true of DR—CAFTA.
   __label__laborrights;  The CAFTA labor chapter is also a step backwards from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the only tool that has generated the political leverage to demand the reform of labor laws in Central America. U.S. unilateral trade preference programs provide for the withdrawal of trade benefits if steps are not taken to meet international labor standards, including steps to reform weak domestic laws. Almost every labor law reform that has taken place in Central America over the past fifteen years has been the result of the threat to withdraw trade benefits under our preference programs. Indeed, on the merits of petitions submitted by the AFL-CIO and the International Labor Rights Fund, Guatemala was put under GSP review in 2002 for its failure to amend its labor code consistent with international standards, its failure to effectively enforce its existing labor code and its failure to investigate the murder of numerous trade unionists. This important tool will be lost once the CAFTA is enacted.
   __label__nonrel;  The much anticipated "white book," entitled "The Labor Dimension in Central America and the Dominican Republic," does little to assuage WOLA's well founded fear that the governments of Central America and the Dominican Republic will fail to adopt, implement and/or enforce internationally recognized worker rights. Indeed, the book demonstrates that the Labor Ministers are in denial about their labor laws. The white book repeats the often stated myth that the reports authored by the International Labor Organization (ILO) in 2003 and 2004 held that the constitutions and labor codes of Central America incorporate ILO fundamental rights and principles. This is simply not true. For example, a letter from the House Committee of Ways and Means to the U.S. Trade Representative, dated April 5, 2005 identifies over twenty instances where, according to reports from the ILO and the State Department, Central American labor laws still fail to comply with international norms relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining. Far from being technical violations, these substandard laws prevent workers from exercising their basic rights.
   __label__nonrel;  Also, while the white book acknowledges some of the most serious problems on the issue of enforcement and makes several recommendations to correct them, it is worth noting that a number of those reforms have been promised for years and have yet to materialize. In other cases, Legislation to reform some of these laws has been languishing in the legislature for years for lack of political will. Moreover, it does not appear that there are any new funds currently allocated to act upon the report's recommendations. The authors call for a conference of donors to be held within 30 days to obtain commitments on funding the recommendations and further funding for management of the technical assistance. Given the deep cuts in the U.S. international labor affairs budget, it is unlikely that sufficient funds will be allocated.
   __label__nonrel;  As firmly established by the International Labor Organization, Guatemalan labor law simply fails to meet international labor standards. These shortcomings have been elaborated numerous times by the ILO's Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR), by local and international trade unions, and by GSP petitioners. Although Guatemala did approve labor reforms in April 2001 (Decree 18-2001), these reforms did not take into account many of the ILO's observations. Moreover, key aspects of those reforms were recently challenged and deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Guatemala in August 2004. The much-needed additional reforms to the Labor Code, promised by the Berger Administration, have still not been enacted.
   __label__laborrights __label__enforcement;  Most troubling is that the Constitutional Court divested the General Inspector of Labor of its authority to levy administrative fines against labor-law violators in August 2004. Until the labor code is reformed, labor inspectors will be essentially powerless to punish violations of labor rights in Guatemala. Given that the only enforceable clause in the DR-CAFTA is that a country enforced its own laws, Guatemala is simply unable to comply with this basic requirement.
   __label__nonrel;  These and other concerns, including continuing violence against trade unionists, were raised in a recent GSP petition, filed with the USTR on December 13, 2004. The USTR has yet to determine whether to accept the petition. The full petition is available at: http://www.wola.orgieconomickafta gsp petition press release.htm. A letter from over 30 members of congress to the U.S.-Trade Representative, in support of the GSP petition, is available at: http://www.wola.orgig-uatemala/ gspclearcolleagueletter.pdf.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  International conventions, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognize that access to health care is a fundamental human right. For example, Article 12 of the ICESCR obliges states to "recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health." Of course, access to affordable medicine is an integral part of the right to health care. In the trade context, the TRIPS Agreement, together with the Doha Declaration, requires that intellectual property rules will not interfere with promoting access to medicines. DR–CAFTA does not embody the letter or the spirit of these international obligations, frustrating access to affordable medicines to millions of people in Central America.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  For example, Chapter 15 of DR–CAFTA appears to set up barriers to compulsory licenses, which allow governments to obtain cheaper generic drugs by temporarily overriding a pharmaceutical patent. The agreement does so by prohibiting generic suppliers of patented drugs from obtaining marketing approval during the lifetime of the patent. Thus, governments would be unable to make affordable generic equivalents of patented medicines available to its citizens. Also troubling is the requirement that governments recognize exclusivity on test data, which is used by drug companies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of drugs, for five years on new pharmaceuticals. This would deny the manufacturers of generic drugs of the information necessary to prove the safety or efficacy of their products.
    __label__iprights __label__consumers;  The USTR's insistence that Guatemala revoke legislation that sought to ensure access to generic medicines—and which was TRIPS consistent—is just one more example where the development needs of Central America were frustrated by overreaching by the USTR. In December 2004, Guatemala had passed a law to increase access to affordable, generic medicines. Under that law, local manufacturers of generic medicines could obtain market registration by relying on the tests conducted by brand-name manufacturers if they could demonstrate that their drug was equivalent to the brand-name product. The U.S. insisted, however, that the law was inconsistent with DR–CAFTA and demanded that Guatemala revoke the law if it wished to remain a party to the agreement. After intense U.S pressure, Guatemala repealed the law just days before ratifying DR–CAFTA, effectively putting new, affordable generic drugs out of reach.
    __label__outro __label__position;  The Washington Office on Latin America recognizes that trade can be mutually beneficial for the nations, communities and individuals involved by creating new economic opportunities. However, we are concerned that, on balance, this agreement does not promote the best interests of Central America, the Dominican Republic or, in the long run, the United States. We believe that a bilateral trade relationship that promotes economic opportunity and respects fundamental human rights is possible. WOLA therefore urges the U.S. Congress to reject the DR–CAFTA and instead to work to support far trade and development initiatives that will stimulate sustainable, equitable economic growth in the region.

     __label__consumers __label__environment __label__econsecurity;  The proposed Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) would hurt rural America by outsourcing American farmers and ranchers and their way of life. CAFTA would clear the way to import foreign food produced under standards that do not protect the public health, safety and the environment. The import of these cheaply produced, poor quality foods makes it harder for American farmers and ranchers to provide safe, high quality food for our families
     __label__dispute __label__fdi;  CAFTA would give foreign corporations the ability to challenge local, state, and national laws in closed tribunals that are unaccountable to U.S. law.
     __label__fdi __label__dispute;  CAFTA Chapter 10 contains the same language of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Chapter 11. This chapter includes "investor to state" provisions allowing foreign companies to sue local, state and federal governments over laws protecting the health and safety of your constituents' families Under this provision, three unelected bureaucrats determine if corporate profits should take precedence over the health and safety of U.S. citizens, preempting the U.S. judicial system. CAFTA would open the way for more investor-to-state cases from six more countries. The U.S. Trade Representative should not be allowed to negotiate trade agreements that undermine your right and ability to enforce the very laws you pass to protect human health and safety.
    __label__nonrel;  A recent NAFTA Chapter 11 case directly challenges our ability to protect U.S. food safety and to prevent cattle disease in the U.S. cattle herd. A Canadian cattlemen's organization has sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under NAFTA Chapter 11 provisions. The Canadian group claims they are due payment for loss of profits because of USDA's regulations Canadian cattle imports. This case is being brought even though the USDA regulations are a direct result of mad cow disease in Canada, even though the regulations were put in place to protect the health of U.S. consumers and cattle markets.
    __label__sanphyto __label__consumers;  U.S. trade agreements should not deny farmers and ranchers access to tools that provide American consumers access to safe, high quality food. Trade agreements must honor local, state and national governments' right to protect the public health and safety of their citizens. WORC calls on the Senate Finance Committee to enact trade policies that expand markets for American farmers and ranchers while providing consumers with good food choices.
    __label__tbts __label__consumers;  Relaxing import restrictions is unwise until we implement mandatory country-oforigin labeling. Until then, consumers will not have the opportunity to choose food grown and processed in the U.S. over imported food from Central America and the Dominican Republic. Mandatory labeling provides a set of comprehensive standards that ensure all food is labeled consistently, in a way that is easy for the consumer to identify and access. This is also vital for livestock producers who want to differentiate their high quality product from products of other countries. Without implementation of the U.S. mandatory country of origin labeling law for meat and produce, these trade agreements short-change our consumers and our producers.
    __label__outro;  Congress has a clear choice. You can continue to approve trade agreements that undermine U.S. laws and chip away at rural America, or you can enact trade policies that provide more opportunities for our farmers and ranchers, keep high quality, safe food for our families, and honor laws that protect Americans.
    __label__outro __label__position;  WORC urges the House Ways and Means Committee to choose policies that strengthen rural America by rejectingthe Central American Free Trade Agreement.

  __label__growth __label__jobs __label__sector  The markets and services industry to the United States economy today cannot be overstated. The U.S. economy is a service economy where better than two-thirds of the GDP is composed of services output. Just over three-fourths of our employment base is provided by the service industries.
  __label__ecommerce __label__country  There's also little argument that many aspects of our Nation's economic life is now, to varying degrees, substantially dependent upon e-commerce. Recent data shows that e-commerce growth is even outpacing the rosy prediction of the dot.com bubble period.
  __label__nonrel;  In 1999, Forester Research, Incorporated, estimated that the U.S. e-commerce between businesses would reach a staggering $1.3 trillion by 2003. Today, Forester Research estimates that network business to business transactions stand at $2.4 trillion. Now, that is near a large percentage of our GDP at a phenomenal growth.
  __label__nonrel;  In rna ional trade is increasingly becoming an important com ponent of our domestic economy. In a recent article, I spoke to the fact that over the past decade the trade deficit of the United States has steadily risen. In 2002 the trade imbalance reached an all-time high of $435 billion, a $100 billion increase over the 2001 def icit.
  __label__nonrel;  Although we suffer from chronic trade imbalances, the trade and services offers a significant bright spot. America rar a record high surplus in services of $69.8 billio.i in 2001, although that surplus shrank to $44.7 billion in 2002.
  __label__growth __label__ecommerce __label__country __label__sector  Another bright spot in our balance of trade calculus is the stead ily increasing international e-commerce, which holds particular promise for United States companies. The Information Technology Industry Council projected that between 1999 and 2003 the market for electronically distributed software alone will grow from $0.5 bil lion to $15 billion. Thus, the services industry and e-commerce are not only key components of our domestic economy, but increasingly trade in services and electronic commerce are becoming growth areas where U.S. firms have a competitive advantage given open and non-discriminatory access to other markets.
  __label__ecommerce __label__exports __label__sector  The FTAs under consideration today, as I noted, represent a sig nificant step forward toward the goal of open and non-discrimina tory international markets for services and e-commerce. The agree ments contain commitments from both Singapore and Chile for substantial market access across nearly all their service sectors, in cluding banking, insurance, telecommunications, computer and re lated services, energy, direct selling, tourism, professional services and even express delivery services.
  __label__forbarriersred __label__transparency __label__sector  This is a significant departure from trade agreements in the past, as all service sectors are opened up, and the few exceptions are memorialized in what is called a negative list. Moreover, the
  __label__nonrel;  Regulatory transparency is very important to many service in dustries, as they are subject to government regulation. Lack of such transparency and regulatory uncertainty are non-tariff bar riers that impede trade and services.
  __label__forbarriersred __label__ecommerce __label__country  In addition, the agreements include significant commitments es tablishing that the principle of non-discrimination applies to prod ucts delivered electronically and prohibiting the levying of custom duties on digital products.
  __label__ecommerce __label__usandpartners  Furthermore, the agreements affirm that commitments made re lating to services also extend to the provisioning of such services via electronic delivery.
  __label__iprights __label__ecommerce;  As noted, the subcommittee plans on a careful examination of both the Chile and Singapore trade agreements, as they contain provisions that the USTR has characterized as being "state-of-the-art" with respect to liberalization of trade and services, e-commerce and the protection of intellectual property rights.
  __label__benchmark __label__world  Another reason for careful examination is that Chile and Singa pore are the first countries in their respective regions to enter into a comprehensive free trade agreement with the United States. It is anticipated that these agreements will serve as blueprihts for fu ture bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, in particular, fu ture free trade agreements with other Southeast Asian and South Itherican nations.
  __label__nonrel;  Careful review is also necessary to ascertain whether pursuit of bilateral agreements undermine multilateral efforts.
  __label__nonrel;  Are the two approaches mutually exclusive or not? On one side, many have pointed to the fact that others, such as Canada and the European Union, have successfully leveraged bilateral free trade agreements to their advantage. Chile is one example cited, where from 1993 to 2001 its trade with the United States increased 100 percent, while its trade with Canada skyrocketed by almost 400 percent. Most of that gain was made after it concluded a bilateral trade agreement with Chile.
  __label__nonrel;  On the other hand, many have spoken of the economic distortion effects and inefficiency that ensued for bilateral trade agreements.
  __label__nonrel;  And finally, my colleagues, a few basic questions must be an swered, such as when all is said and done are these Federal trade agreements good for all Americans? If so, why? And two, who will lose the most, and who will gain the most, as a result of these and future similar Federal trade agreements?
  __label__growth __label__ecommerce __label__alltrade __label__country  Global tradeoffers an opportunity in which all nations involved, I believe that the trade agreements should complement America's strength, particularly in the service sector and e-commerce, without imposing disadvantage on the other sectors of the economy.
 __label__outro;  So, I look forward to our witnesses' testimony.
 __label__nonrel;  With that, the ranking member is recognized.
 __label__intro;  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this timely hearing.
   __label__nonrel;  I would also like to thank the distinguished panels of witnesses here today. Your insight into these Free Trade Agreements will be of considerable interest as we navigate these newly charted waters.
   __label__nonrel;  I am pleased to see such steadfast work on trade negotiations after Congress worked so diligently on the Trade Act of 2002. The decision to grant President Bush Trade Promotion Authority was one that fostered considerable debate. An important result of that debate is the continued involvement of Congress in trade negotiations.
   __label__nonrel;  The Trade Act of 2002 expanded and improved the consultation process between the Administration and Congress before, during, and after trade negotiations and obligates the U.S. Trade Representative to enter into discussions with the House and Senate before it can reach any trade agreement. The Chairman's leadership today is to be commended as he has given us the opportunity to do just that.
   __label__growth __label__state  While today's hearing targets trade in services and e-commerce, I think it is note worthy to briefly address overall aspects of trade policy, particularly pertaining to my home state of Wyoming. The president's ability to take steps more rapidly than ever before is invigorating to businesses across the country; the Wyoming Business Council's International Trade Conference, being held next week, is evidence of this as it seeks to educate Wyoming business people about growth opportunities as new markets are opened. While open markets can be extremely valuable in this way, it is important to note their potential danger fot such sectors as our agriculture pro ducers.
   __label__exports __label__state  Wyoming has numerous, superior products like tfona, wool, oil, beef, sugar beets, coal, Iamb, natural gas, timber and barley. There is no question the quality of our products can compete head-to-head with foreign producers anywhere in the world. That can only be done, however, if our producers are not put at a competitive dis advantage, as they are currently, when selling their goods abroad.
   __label__position;  The U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement paves the way for further progress in the free trade arena. I look forward to learning more about this and the potential Chile Free Trade Agreement and thank the panelists for lending their expertise to the dialogue today.
 __label__outro;  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I yield back the remainder of my time.
   __label__intro;  I would like to thank the Chairman for holding this important hearing and the panelists for joining us today to discuss these landmark trade agreements.
   __label__growth __label__country  The Singapore and Chile Free Trade Agreements represent landmark opportunities for the United States to broaden its trade partnerships and strengthen our nation's economic condition.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__growth __label__smallbiz __label__exports __label__country  When Congress passed Trade Promotion Authority last year, it granted the president the ability to negotiate trade agreements that knock down high tariffs and other trade barriers that stifle the free movement of goods. Expanding free trade will boost our nation's economy by giving American workers and small businesses broad access to new markets.
   __label__nonrel;  International trade is critical to my home state of New Jersey's economy and its workers. Since 1993, New Jersey's exports doubled to $29 billion last year, ranking the state 8th in the nation in total exports. Today, one in seven New Jersey manu facturing jobs are directly tied to exports—and those jobs pay 13 to18 percent higher wages than the national average.
   __label__nonrel;  Singapore and Chile are two important trade allies for the United States. Cur rently, Singapore is the largest trading partner of the United States in Southeast Asia with two-way trade of $32.0 billion. Approximately 1,600 U.S. companies and 20,000 American citizens are located in Singapore, and the country is our nation's 11th largest export market.
   __label__foragrees __label__country  Due to its political and economic stability, Chile is a prime candidate to be the first free trade partner of the U.S. in South America. Many U.S. businesses see Chile as fertile ground for future trade but have pointed to high tariffs when doing business in Chile as detriments to further involvement in trade with that nation. Many U.S. companies also cite that they are at a competitive disadvantage when competing in Chile with countries, such as Canada, that already have free trade ar rangements with that nation.
   __label__nonrel;  Congress must continue to maintain strict oversight on the Singapore and Chile Free Trade Agreements, as well as future trade agreements to ensure that American workers and companies receive the strongest possible advantages. In addition, we must continue to strictly monitor our trade partners so that they maintain vital worker protection and environmental standards.
   __label__benchmark __label__world  These agreements are going to be heavily scrutinized and will be looked upon at as models for future trade pacts. The Singapore agreement is will be considered the starting point for agreements with other Southeast Asian nations, and the Chile
    __label__outro;  These two trade agreements that we will discuss today will be very important to the future economic health of our nation. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman for your continued diligence towards these and other trade matters. I look forward to hearing from the witnesses today.
    __label__intro;  Good morning. Thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing to evaluate an area that will significantly impact our domestic economy as well as our global out look. International trade and free trade agreements are currently vital tools in pro viding new opportunities for our domestic companies as well as shaping our inter national business and foreign policy. I believe that it is extremely important that the Subcommittee expand the scope of international trade matters that it evaluates. Therefore, I am very pleased that the Subcommittee is holding this hearing today.
    __label__exports __label__country  Securing greater market access and ease of entry into new markets will greatly enhance the ability of our domestic industries to expand and prosper. The pending free trade agreements with Singapore and Chile provide substantial new opportuni ties for sale of goods and services to two new consumer markets.
    __label__nonrel;  Last year, Congress passed Trade Promotion Authority. TPA is important because it provides an effective means for us to consider and evaluate free trade agreements with other nations. It established a Congressional Oversight Group, and requires the United States Trade Representative to consult with this group on trade agree ments. As part of the Congressional Oversight Group, the Energy and Commerce Committee has an important role to play in the implementation of new trade agree ments. With jurisdiction over foreign commerce, the Committee will provide over sight and guidance over a significant range of matters contained in these agree ments.
    __label__benchmark __label__world  We should carefully evaluate these agreements to ensure that they provide the best opportunities for U.S. companies looking to expand into new markets. We should also ensure that our domestic industries will not be injured or threatened by foreign firms entering our markets. Another reason to ce.refidly scrutinize these agreements is because they are with the first country in each of their regions to enter into a comprehensive free trade agreement with the U.S and will very likely serve as the model for future free trade agreements with other Southeast Asian and South American nations.
    __label__exports __label__forbarriersred __label__ecommerce __label__country __label__industry  Both agreements will provide open market access for U.S. companies in key are nas. They will also make sure that U.S. companies going into either of these coun tries receive the same treatment as the domestic firms of the country. In Singapore, the aspects of the agreement that deal with the services sector are key, because goods currently have relative ease of entry. The equal market access of the services sector is therefore an important gain for us. Some of the service sectors that will benefit are banking, insurance, financial and professional services. The tele communications and e-commerce sectors will also benefit by receiving non-discrimi natory access to facilities, including submarine cable landing stations. Local firms will no longer have right of first access, thereby providing a level playing field for both domestic and foreign firms.
    __label__transparency __label__exports __label__country  The agreements provide for transparency and non-discrimination for U.S. pro viders. The result will be new market opportunities for our companies seeking to expand abroad, Going into these new markets will let domestic firms grow and ex pand their business where they might not have the opportunity domestically.
    __label__timetable __label__country  Another factor to consider is each of these individual countries. It is my under standing that these countries were chosen as the first in their region due to their stable economies and willingness to cooperate with the U.S. on establishing mutu ally beneficial free trade policies. Indications are that U.S. businesses view each of these markets as prime in which to enter right now.
    __label__alltrade __label__usandpartners  After a return to a democratic government in 1990, Chile is developing into an open, reformed and developed economy. Since its transition from a state economy to a privatized economy, Chile has shown its willingness to implement market-based principles in every industry sector. In addition to providing additional growth oppor tunities for our domestic companies, we should also be encouraging free trade with countries who are committed to developing a system of free enterprise. U.S. trade with Chile is currently not of significant proportions. This agreement will be a step toward increasing that trading relationship. Chile and Canada entered into a free
   __label__nonrel;  Singapore is also considered to be an open economy committed to market based principles. Prior to entry into the free trade agreement, it has relatively low trade barriers, and has permitted access to U.S. companies and therefore, is an economy we should assist in developing, as it would result in a direct trading benefit to our own economy. The key, of course, is benefit to our domestic industries. During an economic time when U.S. companies may be exploring new markets, these agree ments will provide them with an entirely new consumer base for their products and services.
   __label__outro;  I welcome our distinguished panel of speakers and look forward to their testimony today, and I yield back the balance of my time.
 __label__nonrel;  Mr. IVES. I'm sure I will not use the full time.
    __label__nonrel;  Thank you Mr. Chairman, Congresswoman Schakowsky, and Members of this Committee, for inviting me to testify today on the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agree ment (FTA) and for this Subcommittee's guidance during the negotiating process. I welcome this opportunity to review the accomplishments of the FTA and present the Administration's request for favorable consideration of legislation needed to im plement the FTA later this year.
   __label__intro;  Mr. Chairman, Congresswoman Schakowsky, and members of the subcommittee, I am honored to appear before you today to dis cuss the benefits of the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement will offer American businesses, workers, farmers and consumers.
   __label__position;  At the outset, I want to thank each of you and your staff for the suggestions and support you provided during the negotiation of this agreement.
   __label__nonrel;  The agreement, the result of long-term bipartisan efforts and an open transparent negotiating process, makes sound economic sense for the United States and Chile, and represents a win-win, state-of-the-art agreement for a modern economy.
   __label__nonrel;  Over the past 15 to 20 years, Chile has established a thriving de mocracy and an open economy built on trade. It is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and its sound economic policies are reflected in its investment grade capital market ratings unique in South America.
   __label__alltrade __label__exports __label__foragrees __label__country  Last year, our bilateral trade stood at $6.4 billion, with $2.6 bil lion in U.S. exports. But, we can do better. Chile already has free trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, Mercosur, and since Feb ruary the European Union. This has disadvantaged U.S. exporters.
   __label__exports __label__sector  The National Association of Manufacturers, for example, esti mates the lack of an FTA with Chile is costing the United States at least $1 billion in lost exports annually.
   __label__exports __label__consumers __label__country  An FTA with Chile will ensure that we enjoy market access, treatment, prices and protections, at least as good as our competi tors. Consumers will benefit from lower prices and more choices.
   __label__broadening __label__usleadership __label__world  The agreement will also spur progress in the free trade area of the Americas, and will send a positive signal throughout the world and, particularly, in the Western Hemisphere, that we will work in partnership with those who are committed to free markets.
   __label__nonrel;  The English version of the Chile agreement has been on the USTR website since April 3, and we continue with our internal work to produce an authentic Spanish language text. No decision has yet been made on the timing or venue for signing the Chile FTA. We were, of course, disappointed over Chile's stand at the U.N. on Iraq, but President Bush has said, "They are friends of ours, we have got an important free trade agreement with Chile that we are going to move forward with." That is what we are doing, when the agreement is ready to be signed, we will make final decisions on dates and logistics.
   __label__nonrel;  Let me just add that throughout the negotiations we conducted an extensive consultative process of public hearings and briefings and frequent consultations with congressional staff, private sector advisors and civil society groups, to develop positions and provide' re ar updates on progress in the negotiations.
   __label__mobilization;  Like the Singapore FTA, 30 of our 31 official advisory groups support the agreement.
   __label__nonrel;  I think the results of this process have yielded an exemplary agreement. I'd like to highlight four features that distinguish the U.S.-Chile FTA from the other 150 or so free trade agreements that
   __label__forbarriersred __label__country  First, it's comprehensive. All growth will be duty and quota free within 12 years, with 87 percent of bilateral trade receiving imme diate duty-free access.
   __label__transparency __label__partner  Second, it promotes transparency. Transparency provisions, both in the transparency chapter and throughout the agreement, pro mote open, impartial procedures and underscore Chile's commit ment to a rules-based global trading system.
   __label__govprocure __label__transparency __label__partner  Regulatory procedures require advanced notice, comment periods and publication of all regulations, similar to our own Administra tive Procedures Act. There is an explicit provision that requires bribery in government procurement to be treated as a criminal of fense, and dispute settlement provisions, both State to State and investor State, provide for open hearings, public release of submis sions, and the opportunity for interested third parties to submit views, objectives that the United States has long sought in the WTO.
   __label__iprights __label__fdi __label__sector  Third, the agreement is modern. Strengthen protection for intel lectual property rights and investment, the broad scope of the serv ices obligations, and new provisions on telecommunications, elec tronic commerce, express delivery and professional services, recog nize the digital age and the emergency of new industry.
   __label__environment __label__laborrights __label__enforcement __label__dispute __label__usandpartners  Finally, in keeping with TPA mandates, it uses an innovative ap proach that supports and promotes respect for the environment and worker rights, with enforceable obligations in the agreement sub ject to effective dispute settlement designed to encourage compli ance.
   __label__benchmark __label__world  Conclusion of the Chile FTA has provided momentum to other hemispheric and global trade liberalization efforts, by breaking ground on new issues and demonEitrating what a 21st Century trade agreement should be.
   __label__outro;  I want to thank you for this hearing today, and I'm happy to an swer any questions you may have.
   __label__intro;  Mr. Chairman, Congresswoman Schakowsky, and Members of the Subcommittee: I am honored to appear before you today to testify on the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement (FM). I also want to thank each of you and your staffs for the sugges tions and support you have provided during the negotiations of the agreement.
   __label__position;  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the U.S.-Chile FrA and to describe the bene fits it will offer American businesses and consumers. The agreement, the result of a long-term bipartisan effort and an open, transparent negotiating process, makes sound economic sense for the United States and Chile and represents a win-win, state-of-the-art trade agreement for a modern economy.
   __label__usleadership __label__world  It makes sound economic sense for the United States to have a free trade agree ment with Chile. Although Chile was only our 36th largest trading partner in goods in 2002 (with $2.6 billion in exports and $3.8 billion in imports), Chile has one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Its sound economic policies are reflected in its investment grade capital market ratings, unique in South America. Over the past 15-20 years, Chile has established a thriving democracy, a thriving economy,
  __label__exports __label__foragrees __label__consumers __label__sector __label__country  Moreover, a U.S.-Chile FTA will help U.S. manufacturers, suppliers, farmers, workers, consumers and investors achieve a level playing field. Chile already has FTAs with Mexico, Canada, Mercosur, and—since February—the EU. As a result, its trade with these economies is growing while American companies are being dis advantaged. The National Association of Manufacturers estimates the lack of a
  __label__nonrel;  The Administration has not yet set a date for signing of the U.S.-Chile FTA. It should come as no surprise that people within the Adnunistration and in Congress were disappointed with Chile's posits'., on Iraq in the U.N. Security Council. But, as Secretary Powell said in his speech to the Council of the Americas last week, "That's behind us now." He went on to urge Chile and others to support U.S. recon struction plans for Iraq. Ambassador Zoellick has said, "We feel we have a good agreement, we feel it's good for both countries, and I have no doubt that ultimately we'll proceed." At USTR, we are continuing to move forward with ourpreparations for signing and implementation. Ambassador Zoellick briefed the Congressional Oversight Group on April 11 on both the Singapore and the Chile FTAs. Both Am bassador Zoellick and I are consulting with others on the Hill on the Chile FTA and would welcome your views on the timing of signing.
  __label__nonrel;  There also are very important practical concerns we have with Chile that didn't exist with Singapore. The English and Spanish language texts of the U.S.-Chile PTA will be-equally authentic. Chile needs to sign an official Spanish-language version of the text to submit to its congress. This is not a simple undertaking. We are work ing closely with our Chilean counterparts to obtain final Spanish language trans lations of all chapters in the agreement to allow the State Department to compare the Spanish and English texts, and to propose any modifications. Once we obtain the State Department's recommendations, we will need to agree on any changes with Chile before the Spanish language version of the text can be finalized.
  __label__mobilization;  The U.S.-Chile FTA is truly a bipartisan effort. Negotiations were launched under the Clinton Administration in December 2000. After fourteen rounds, negotiations were concluded under the Bush Administration in December 2002.
  __label__nonrel;  In fact, discussions about a bilateral free trade agreement have been going on much longer. As Ambassador Zoellick stated in his congressional notification last fall, "the origins of an agreement with Chile date back to the Administration of President George H.W. Bush, when the first discussions were held regarding a pos sible Chile FTA." In the mid-90's, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) countries (the United States, Canada and Mexico) invited Chile to dock into the NAFTA. However, with the subsequent lapse of what was then known as "fast-track authority", docking didn't appear feasible. The United States and Chile instead initiated a "I'll.ade and Investment Framework Agreement (TWA) to facilitate bilateral trade and investment liberalization and pave the way for a future FTA.
  __label__nonrel;  As a footnote, discussions about a U.S.-Chile bilateral trade agreement have been going on much longer than a decade. Chilean historians inform us that these discus sions began in the 1800's when Chilean Ambassador Pangea was sent as a special emissary to the United States to propose a bilateral trade agreement to President Jackson. Unfortunately, President Jackson was not persuaded. Ambassador Pangea may have been a bit ahead of his time, but I think you all would agree the PTA with Chile has been in the works for a long time—and has truly enjoyed bipartisan support.
  __label__nonrel;  The process of developing U.S. proposals and concluding the U.S.-Chile FTA was open and transparent. Even before Trade Promotion Authority was granted, the Of fice of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) held public briefings and consulted frequently with Congressional staff, private sector advisors, and civil society groups. We continued this process after the Trade Act of 2002 was enacted in August, meet 
  __label__position __label__transparency __label__environment __label__laborrights __label__usandpartners  The U.S.-Chile FM is a win-win, state-of-the-art trade agreement for a modern economy. USTR's website (www.ustr.gov) has a nine-page summary of the ment as well as the English version of the texts. I will highlight the most sifigi points.
 __label__forbarriersred __label__country  We challeqged ourselves to be as open as possible, across the board.  
   __label__foragrees __label__forbarriersred __label__sector  Our key concern was to level the playing field to ensure that U.S. access to Chile would be as good as that of the EU or Canada, both of which have FFAs with Chile. Chile's commitment to eliminate its agricultural price bands, which it had retained in previous trade agreements, was an essential component of our decision to liber alize all trade.
  __label__forbarriersred __label__dombarriersred __label__industry  Among the key features, access for beef in both countries will be completely liber alized over four years. U.S. beef exporters will be permitted to use U.S. grading standards when they market beef in Chile. Chile is finalizing the administrative regulations necessary to recognize the U.S. meat inspection system—to the benefit of U.S. beef and pork exporters. Tariffs on U.S. and Chilean wines will first be equalized at low U.S. rates and then eliminated. Chile also agreed to eliminate a 50 percent surcharge on used goods (important for capital goods exporters), to end duty drawback and duty deferral programs after a transition and to eliminate its 85 percent "auto luxury tax" in four years.
  __label__safeguards __label__industry  In addition to longer phase-out periods on sensitive products, the Trade Remedies chapter provides for temporary safeguards to be imposed when increased imports constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or threat of serious injury to a do mestic industry. Special safeguards are also provided for certain textile and agricul tural products.
  __label__forbarriersred __label__sector  Services. Today 80% of Americans work for service companies, and about two-thirds of our GDP is in services. We improved upon the approach used in the WTO and used a "negative list" approach for negotiating market access rights so that all services are included with very few exceptions. There are broad commitments on both sides.
  __label__govprocure __label__partner  Government Procurement. This is the first FTA to explicitly recognize that build operate-transfer contracts are government procurement. The Government Procure ment provisions cover purchases of most Chilean government infrastructure and re source projects, including ports and airports, as well as central government entities and more than 350 municipalities.
  __label__transparency __label__partner  Transparency provisions both in the Transparency chapter and throughout the agreement promote open, impartial procedures and underscore Chile's commitment to the rules-based global trading system. General provisions ensure open, trans parent, regulatory procedures by requiring advP.nce notice, comment periods and publication of all regulations.
   __label__rulesoforig __label__smallbiz __label__transparency __label__customs __label__usandpartners  Provisions to streamline customs procedures and simplify rules-of origin will fa cilitate taking advantage of the new trade openings, and will be particularly helpful to small and medium-sized enterprises. The U.S.-Chile FTA and the U.S.-Singapore FTA will be the first FTAs anywhere in world to have specific, concrete obligations to enhance transparency and efficiency of customs procedures. All customs laws, regulations and guidelines are required to be published on the Internet. The private sector may request binding advance rulings on customs matters. Additional provi sions allow rapid release of goods, including expedited treatment for express deliv ery shipments.
   __label__rulesoforig __label__usandpartners  The rules of origin in the agreement are straightforward and simplified. Based on our experience with NAFTA, we were able to minimize the use of complicated re gional content value calculations.
   __label__transparency __label__sector  The Services chapter provides additional procedural _requirements regarding transparency in development and application of regulations, including the require ment to establish a mechanism for responding to questions on regulatory issues. These advancements are particularly crucial for the services sector since many sec tors are regulated and transparency is needed to guarantee that market access im provements can be fully exploited.
   __label__govprocure;  The Government Procurement chapter requires open and transparent qualifica tion and tendering procedures, with only limited restrictions. It also requires Chile to establish an impartial authority to hear supplier complaints about the implemen tation of tie government procurement obligations. Importantly, it specifically re quires that any bribery in government procurement be considered a criminal offense in U.S. and Chilean laws, furthering hemispheric anti-corruption goals.
   __label__dispute __label__usandpartners  Dispute Settlement provisions provide for open public hearings, the opportunity for interested third paries to submit views, and public release of submissions, objec tives that the United States has long sought in the WTO. Similar transparency pro visions apply to investor-state disputes.
   __label__iprights __label__fdi __label__usandpartners  The agreement is modern in its approach to technology and business practices, en compassing strengthened protection for intellectual property rights and investment, and new provisions on telecommunications, electronic commerce, express delivery and temporary entry.
   __label__iprights __label__partner  Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). The agreement provides state-of the art protec tion for digital products such as U.S. software, music, text and videos. IPR protec tion for patents, trademarks and trade secrets exceeds that in prior agreements and obligates Chile to provide protection at a level that reflects U.S. standards.
   __label__fdi __label__dispute __label__partner  Investment. The agreement provides important protections for U.S. investors in Chile. The agreement ensures that U.S. investors will enjoy national treatment and MFN treatment in Chile in almost all circumstances. The investment provisions draw from U.S. legal principles and practices, including due process and trans parency. All forms of investment are protected under the agreement,_such as ente.e prises, debt, concessions, contracts and intellectual property. Expedited procedures will help deter and eliminate frivolous claims, and provide for efficient selection of arbitrators and prompt resolution of claims. The agreement also contemplates the establishment of an appellate mechanism to review awards under the Investment Chapter, permitting the Parties to establish a bilateral appellate mechanism or to establish a future multilateral appellate mechanism. Standards are established for expropriation and compensation for expropriation, and for fair and equitable treat ment. Performance requirements are prohibited, except in certain limited cir cumstances. Free transfer of funds is protected. Under special dispute settlement provisions, however, Chile shall not incur liability if Chilean authorities exercise, for a limited period, narrow flexibility to restrict certain capital flows that Chile con siders potentially destabilizing.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__industry  Telecommunications. The telecommunications chapter improves on Chile's WTO obligations. It ensures non-discriminatory access to, and use of, Chile's public tele communications network, coupled with sound regulatory measures to prevent abuses by the dominant incumbent service supplier. In addition, the agreement in cludes a commitment from Chile to allow market entry for basic telecommunications services. This market access to Chile's telecommunications sector is essential for the continued development of innovative and new service offerings.
   __label__govprocure __label__transparency __label__industry  The agreement will require a greater level of transparency in dealing with major suppliers of public telecommunication services, transparent regulatory processes, and strong regulatory enforcement powers. It also provides flexibility to account for changes that may occur through new legislation or new regulatory decisions. For eign companies operating in the U,S. telecommunications sector enjoy a high degree
  __label__ecommerce __label__usandpartners  Electronic Commerce. The E-Commerce chapter is a breakthrough in achieving certainty and predictability for market access of products such as computer pro grams, video images, sound recordings and other digitally encoded products. The commitments provide that digital products that are imported or exported through electronic means will not be subject to customs duties. Furthermore, each side will determine customs valuation on the basis of the carrier medium, e.g., optical media or tape, rather than content. Both the United States and Chile commit to non-dis criminatory treatment of digital products. Electronic commerce is an area of trade that has been, for the most part, free of many traditional trade barriers (duties, dis crimination, protectionism). The U.S.-Chile FTA binds the current level of openness for trade in this area by reaching an agreement that prevents such barriers from being imposed in the future.
  __label__nonrel;  Services. In addition to obtaining increased market access for U.S. banks, insur ance companies, telecommunications companies, and securities firms, the FTA for the first time recognizes "express delivery" as a distinct industry. Express delivery service commitments are based on an expansive definition of the integrated nature of services. Express delivery services obtain expedited customs clearance. Special provisions will deter postal carriers from cross-subsidizing competing services.
  __label__immigration __label__usandpartners  Temporary Entry. The Temporal), Entry chapter facilitates the movement of businesspersons engaged in the trade of goods and services, and the conduct of in vestment activities. It establishes transparent criteria and procedures for entry of businesspersons in four categories: business visitors, intra-company transferees, traders and investors, and professionals. The first three categones will be imple mented using our current system. Unlike the NAFTA, which includes a list of indi vidual professions, the FTA employs a general definition based on educational achievement. This general definition will be able to accommodate changes to the workforce that take place over time. Based on Congressional consultations, we set an annual numerical limit of 1,400 new Chilean professionals. Finally, the chapter preserves the ability of the Congress and regulators to legislate and develop new procedures in the area of temporary entry subsequent to the entry into force of the agreement.
  __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__dispute __label__usandpartners  Both the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore FFAs took into account Congressional guidance and built upon the Jordan Agreement by including in the agreemenns mechanisms for consultation, dialogue, and public participation. These FTAs encour 
  __label__growth __label__usandpartners  As Ambassador Zoellick said, "The U.S.-Chile FTA is a partnership for growth, a partnership in creating economic opportunity for the people of both countries."
  __label__growth __label__usleadership __label__partner __label__world  The result of Chile's openness has been the best growth record in Latin America, averaging over 6 percent per year through the 1990's. This growth enabled Chile to cut its poverty rate in half, from 45 percent in 1987 to 22 percent in 1998. The U.S.-Chile FTA will help Chile sustain this growth and will send a strong signal to the hemisphere that the United States wants to work in partnership to promote mutual economic growth.
  __label__usleadership __label__world  Conclusion of the Chile FTA has provided momentum to other hemispheric and global trade liberalization efforts by breaking ground on new issues and dem onstrating what a 21st century trade agreement should be. We continue to move for ward with the centerpiece of our hemispheric integration strategy, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). We maintain our strong commitment to the negotia 
  __label__broadening;  The U.S.-Chile FTA and the CAFFA will serve as building blocks for the FTAA. They will give both aides greater access to others' markets at an earlier date than is possible under the FrAA. At the same time, these bilateral PTAs strengthen ties and integration, demonstrating the additional benefits available through the FTAA.
  __label__nonrel;  Together with other more developed countries in the hemisphere, such as Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Chile, we continue to work on the hemispheric cooperation pro gram. The program will help all nations in the hemisphere benefit from the FTAA, by providing appropriate technical assistance and trade capacity building to FFAA nations requiring assistance.
  __label__position;  With Congressional guidance and support, this Administration is pursuing an am bitious and comprehensive trade policy. We will continue to move forward bilat erally, regionally and globally. Together, we can show the world the power of free trade to strengthen democracy and promote prosperity.
 __label__intro;  Ms. O'NEILL. Thank you.
  __label__intro;  And, thank you very much for inviting me here. My remarks will focus on the benefit of the agreement to the high-tech sector and to global electronic commerce.
  __label__nonrel;  As many have noted today, technology is a key driver making our economy more efficient, productive, competitive and integrated, and experts predict that this will continue in the coming decades.
  __label__ecommerce __label__exports __label__country  However, in order to facilitate growth in electronic commerce, and expand sales of U.S. information and communications technology products and services, also known as ICTs, in the coming years it will be necessary to work diligently on the trade front to reduce barriers to U.S. exports and to maintain a barrier-free environment for electronic commerce.
  __label__ecommerce __label__forbarriersred __label__country  The U.S.-Singapore and the U.S-Chile Free Trade Agreements, represent groundbreaking progress toward achieving these goals. First, turning to Singapore, by opening trade in the high-tech sector and keeping the Internet barrier free, the U.S.-Singapore FTA will generate opportunities for U.S. companies to benefit from Singapore's high level of engagement in the digital economy, and their forward-looking approach to the development and use of ICTs. Specifically, in terms of electronic commerce, the agreement establishes explicit guarantees that U.S. digital products will receive the same treatment as Singaporean digital products. The agreement also memorializes a binding commitment on the global moratorium on customs duties on digital products, commits both countries to assess customs duties for digital products delivered on hard media, such as a DVD or CD, on the value of the media, not on the value of the movie, music or software contained on the disc, and affirms that any commitments made related to services also extend to the delivery of such services delivered over the Internet.
   __label__nonrel;  In addition, alongside the agreement, we also completed the U.S.-Singapore Joint Statement, which includes a range of coopera tive activities in the e-commerce area.
   __label__nonrel;  Some of the benefits for the high-tech sector include an imme diate reduction to zero of all tariffs on U.S. ICT products entering Singapore. There's also a full range of -commitments on telecommunication services that provide for open markets consistent with the regulatory regimes of the U.S. and Singapore.
   __label__nonrel;  And finally, the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement also pro vides for a high level of intellectual property rights protection, dis cipline on anti-competitive measures and government procurement, and an innovative dispute settlement mechanism applying to all core obligations of the agreement, which will make it easier for high-tech companies to trade with Singapore.
   __label__nonrel;  In addition, Singapore will provide substantial market access across its entire services regime, subject to very few exceptions.
   __label__exports __label__ecommerce __label__industry  Now, turning to the Chile agreement, the agreement, in our view, will provide new opportunities for U.S. companies looking to export ICTs and will encourage cross border electronic commerce transactions, by guaranteeing a level playing field for companies doing business in Chile.
   __label__exports __label__development __label__partner  Conversely, the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement will also make it easier for Chile to obtain ICTs from the United States and stand out in the region as a strong supporter of digital economy develop ments. 
   __label__ecommerce __label__industry   The agreement provides most of the same benefits to industry re lated to electronic commerce as does the U.S.-Singapore FTA, one exception being that the e-commerce chapter also contains a provision for future cooperation, very similar to that provided for in 0-e U.S.-Singapore Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__exports __label__industry  All tariffs on U.S. ICT products entering, Chile will be reduced to zero, which much like in the case of Singapore will be beneficial to U.S. hardware and software exporters who were previously assessed a 6 percent duty on their products.
   __label__nonrel;  And then in the telecom area, the key elements are similar to those in Singapore. The completion of the chapter in the U.S.-Chile FTA is significant because it binds two of the most open and ad vanced telecommunications markets in the world to a set of progressive rules and regulations, building on NAFTA, the GATT's telecommunications annex, and the WTO reference paper, to form a comprehensive provision.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__sector  And then in addition, the commitments for deregulation of infor mation services and reasonable access to lease lines are stronger in the U.S.-Chile FTA and U.S. industry will benefit additionally from a commitment to allow access to the market for local-basic services, a commitment Chile does not currently have under the WTO.
   __label__mobilization;  As you will probably hear from the next panel, the industry in the high-tech sectors and those engaged in electronic commerce have indicated strong support for these agreements. In the electronic commerce space, U.S. industry has stated that they believe these agreements will set a model for negotiating objectives on electronic commerce in the WTO, and will establish internationally ac cepted mechanisms for how their goals in electronic commerce can be achieved at a global level.
  __label__mobilization;  We also understand that industry is supportive of the tele communications chapters in the U.S.-Singapore FTA and in the U.S.-Chile FTA.
  __label__outro;  In conclusion, I would just like to reiterate that the agreements in our view do represent a groundbreaking first step toward estab lishing a trade rules regime for electronic commerce that will pre vent the creation of barriers to this new type of trade. The FTAs will provide a high degree of certainty and predictability for U.S. businesses in these markets that will most likely make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to export to Chile and Singa pore.
  __label__nonrel;  And, with that, I will thank you and be pleased to answer any questions you have.
   __label__intro;  Mr. Chairman, Congresswoman Schakowsky, and Members of this Subcommittee: Thank you for inviting me to testify today on the benefits to the high-tech sector and to global electronic commerce of the U.S.-Singapore and the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). I welcome the opportunity to talk with you today about how these Agreements represent breakthroughs in the facilitation of global elec tronic trade.
   __label__nonrel;  Despite the downturn in the high-tech sector and the burst of the dotcom bubble, information and communications technologies (ICTs) and electronic commerce re main important parts of our economic growth and continue to revolutionize the way we do business, the way we govern and the way we live.
   __label__nonrel;  Technology is a key driver making our economy more efficient, productive, com petitive and integrated, and experts predict that this will continue in the coming decades. In fact, private market research firms predict continued growth in the value of global electronic commeme transactions over the next few years. Most project that the value of electronic ti .1de in goods and services will reach somewhere between $3 and $9 trillion by 2005.
   __label__nonrel;  This growth has been fueled by sub Aantial increases in the number of people on line in 2002, with the total number reaching approximately 655 million or one-tenth of the world's population. (UNCTAD E-Commerce and Development Report 2002)
   __label__nonrel;  As a result of the current weakness in U.S. business and consumer spending on ICTs, foreign markets have become even more important to the U.S. high-tech sec tor. The U.S. software industry continues to dominate both pre-packaged and cus tom software markets; and the U.S. IT industry is a strong performer, highly re. garded for technological leadership, innovation, and for the product quality and reli ability.
   __label__exports __label__ecommerce __label__country  In order to facilitate growth in electronic commerce and expand sales of U.S. ICI` products and services in the coming years, it will be necessary to work diligently on the trade front to reduce barriers to U.S. exports of high-tech products and serv ices, and to maintain a barrier-free environment for electronic commerce.
   __label__position;  The U.S.-Singapore and U.S.-Chile FTAs represent ground-breaking progress towards reaching these goals.
   __label__nonrel;  Singapore is a regional hub for electronic commerce transactions, and has one of the most advanced information and communications infrastructures in the world. This has been facilitated by the small size of the country, the high national income and the government's commitment to develop the country into a global ICT capital by 2010. Singapore's telecommunications services market will exceed $3.8 billion in end-user spending in 2003. Virtually every home in Singapore has a fixed telephone line. Mobile phone _penetration reached an all-time high of 78.6 percent in January 2003.
   __label__nonrel;  There are more than two million Internet subscribers in Singapore, and every school and public library is equipped with personal computers with broadband ac 
   __label__nonrel;  Total electronic commerce revenues in Singapore should reach $8.3 billion in 2003, with the United States as the single largest country source for their overseas electronic commerce revenue. Typical electronic commerce transactions in Singapore range from business-to-business order processing, invoicing and payment to busi ness-to-consumer online shopping and Internet banking and trading.
   __label__nonrel;  Singapore is a leader in the area of electronic government, with 44 percent of its citizens regularly using government services online. Last year, Accenture ranked Singapore number two in terms of overall maturity in online government services—the United States ranked number three.
   __label__nonrel;  Singapore and the U.S. were able to agree to provisions on electronic commerce that reflect the issue's importance in global trade, and the principle of avoiding bar riers that impede the use of electronic commerce, which were the principal negoti ating objectives in the area of electronic commerce set out in the Trade Act of 2002.
   __label__nonrel;  The Agreement establishes explicit guarantees that the principle of non-discrimination applies to products delivered electronically (software, music, video, text), thus providing fair treatment to U.S. firms delivering products via the Internet. This reflects the development of products traded electronically and the need for predictability in how digital products are treated in terms of trade.
   __label__nonrel;  The U.S.-Singapore FTA also prohibits charging customs duties on digital products delivered electronically, such as digital downloads of music, videos, software or text. This makes permanent the moratorium on placing duties on online transactions that is now only voluntary or temporary in the World Trade Organization
   __label__nonrel;  Another major benefit is that for digital products delivered on hard media (such as DVD or CD), customs duties will be based on the value of the media (e.g., the disk), not on the value of the movie, music or software contained on the disk. This will set a useful precedent in the global arena, even though Singapore will not im pose tariffs on either the media or content.
   __label__nonrel;  The electronic commerce text also makes a number of commitments permanent and enforceable, that are now only voluntary or temporary in the World Trade Or ganization (WTO), and it affirms that any commitments made related to services in this Agreement also extend to the electronic delivery of such services delivered over the Internet. This sets a very good precedent for services liberalization efforts in the WTO and in other FTAs.
   __label__nonrel;  The U.S.-Singapore FTA will make it easier for U.S. companies to compete in elec tronic government bid processes, as well, as both the Government Procurement and Electronic Commerce Chapters prevent discriminatory practices related to digital products.
   __label__nonrel;  U.S. industry has indicated a strong support for the Electronic Commerce Chapter in the U.S.-Singapore FTA, as they believe that it will set a model for negotiating objectives on electronic commerce in the WTO, and will establish internationally ac cepted mechanisms for how their goals on electronic commerce can be achieved on a global level. In particular, U.S. industry has expressed its approval that the con 
   __label__nonrel;  Alongside the negotiations on electronic commerce, we also completed the U.S. Singapore Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce, which was signed by Secretary of Commerce Evans and Singapore Minister for Trade, George Yeo on May 5, 2003 in Washington, D.C.
   __label__nonrel;  The Joint Statement embodies the U.S. Government's policy priorities in the area of electronic commerce and demonstrates a clear commitment by both Parties to abide by the stated general principles, which includes an agreement to allow the pri vate sector to take the lead in establishing and developing electronic business prac tices.
   __label__nonrel;  As a corollary to this point, the Parties have made a commitment as governments to avoid imposing unnecessary regulations and restrictions on electronic commerce, and when it is necessary for them to take action, they have promised that their measures will be transparent, minimal, nondiscriminatory and predictable.
   __label__nonrel;  In addition, the Joint Statement provides for future interaction between the United States and Singapore via video conference, seminars, bilateral meetings and discussions on the sidelines of multilateral events, with the goal of increasing co operation on the issues laid out in the agreement.
   __label__nonrel;  We consider this statement as a key tool in our efforts to eliminate potential im pediments to electronic commerce, including cooperation on removing unnecessary regulatory barriers, securing networks, increasing consumer trust and strength ening 1PR protections.
   __label__nonrel;  By locking in zero tariffs on all U.S. products entering Singapore, the U.S.-Singa pore FTA will benefit U.S. exports of ICTs. The U.S.-Singapore FTA also provides for a high-level of intellectual property rights protection, provisions relating to anti competitive behavior and an innovative dispute settlement mechanism applying to all core obligations of the Agreement, which will make it easier for high-tech compa nies to conduct trade with Singapore.
   __label__nonrel;  In addition, a full range of commitments on telecommunications services in the U.S.-Singapore PTA provide for open markets, consistent with the regulatory re gimes of the U.S. and Singapore. The Agreement guarantees reasonable and non-discriminatory access to the network by users, thus preventing local firms from having preferential or "first right" of access to telecommuni cations networks.
   __label__nonrel;  Under the Agreement U.S. phone companies obtained the right to interconnect with networks in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions and cost-oriented rates that are transparent and reasonable, and U.S. firms were granted non-discriminatory ac cess to buildings that contain equipment necessary for interconnection and sub marine cable equipment when they seek to build a physical network.
   __label__nonrel;  U.S firms also obtained the right to lease lines at reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms, and to resell telecommunications services of Singaporean suppliers in order to build a customer base. Both Parties agreed to open rule-making procedures of telecommunications regulatory authority, publish interconnections agreements and service rates, and when competition emerges in a telecommunications services area, deregu late that area.
   __label__nonrel;  The Agreement includes the specification that companies, not govern ments, make technology choices, particularly for mobile wireless services, thus allowing firms to compete on the basis of technology and innovation, not on government-mandated standards.
   __label__nonrel;  U.S. telecommunications service suppliers will enjoy fair and non-discriminatory treatment and the right to invest and establish a local services presence. Regulatory authorities under the agreement must use open and transparent administrative pro cedures, consult with interested parties before issuing regulations, provide advance notice and comment periods for proposed rules, and publish all regulations. In addi tion, U.S. firms will now have the right to own equity stakes in entities that may be created if Singapore chooses to privatize certain government-owned services.
   __label__nonrel;  U.S. industry is supportive of the final Telecommunications Chapter in the U.S. Singapore FTA. The Industry Sector Advisory Committee 13 in its Report to Con gress on the U.S.-Singapore FTA, called the benefits to companies in the Tele communications Chapter "notable", and are fully satisfied with its provisions.
   __label__nonrel;  Chile is a leader in telecommunications liberalization and competition in Latin America. It was the first country in the region to initiate privatiza tion in the mid-1970s, and by 1989 all state-owned telephone companies were sold. During the 1990s the telecommunications sector grew at an im pressive average rate of 20 percent per year. U.S. telecommunications equipment exports to Chile exceeded $260 million in 2000. At the beginning of last year, Chile's main line and mobile phone density outpaced its neigh bors at over 25 percent and 30 percent, respectively.
   __label__nonrel;  Chile is also among the leaders in the Latin American region in terms of elec tronic commerce transactions. Chile has an Internet penetration rate of 21 percent, the highest number in Latin America, and is expected to reach 30 percent by next year. Electronic commerce sales in Chile reached $2.5 billion in 2002, up 75 percent from 2001. The Santiago Chamber of Commerce anticipates that electronic com merce sales for 2003 will rise another 70 percent in 2003.
   __label__nonrel;  Chile has demonstrated a great interest in integrating its government services into the digital economy. Since December 2001, all ministries and other gov ernment organizations are required to buy supplies over the Internet. Agen cies are able to purchase goods and services online through the government's pro 
   __label__ecommerce __label__smallbiz __label__usandpartners  The benefits of the U.S.-Chile FTA are very similar to those provided by the U.S. Singapore FTA. The Chile Agreement also contains a section on future areas of co operation between the United States and Chile. This text specifies that the Parties will work together to overcome obstacles encountered by small and medium-sized businesses in the use of electronic commerce; share information on regulations, laws and programs in areas such as data privacy, consumer confidence and cyber-secu rity; maintain cross-border flows of information; encourage the development of self-regulatory methods by the private sector; and, actively participate in international fora to promote electronic commerce.
   __label__position __label__ecommerce;  We look forward to working with Chile on both a bilateral and multilateral level, including in the WTO and in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, on these issues. We are particularly pleased with Chile's commitment to work with us on maintaining trans-border data flows, as we consider this to be essential to the future growth of electronic commerce.
   __label__govprocure;  As in the U.S.-Singapore FTA-, the U.S.-Chile FTA will also make it easier for U.S. companies to compete in electronic government bid processes, as both the Gov ernment Procurement and Electronic Commerce Chapters prevent discriminatory practices related to digital products. In addition, both sides committed to future work on electronic government issues.
   __label__position __label__industry  U.S. industry is equally supportive of the U.S.-Chile FTA Electronic Commerce Chapter, as the U.S.-Singapore Fa. In addition, they believe that the cooperation language related to the cross-border information flows is important, and that it should be included in future FTAs.
   __label__forbarriersred;  Under the U.S.-Chile FTA, all tariffs on U.S. ICT products entering Chile will be reduced to zero, which will be beneficial to U.S. hardware and software exporters who were previously assessed a six percent tariff on their products.
   __label__nonrel;  While the key elements of the Telecommunications Chapter are similar to those in the U.S.-Singapore FTA, the completion of the Chapter in the U.S.-Chile FTA is significant because it binds two of the most open and advanced telecommunications markets in the world to a set of progressive rules and regulations that build upon NAFTA Chapter 13, the GATS Telecommunications Annex, and the WTO Reference Paper to form a comprehensive provision. In addition, the commitments for deregu lation of information services and reasonable access to leased lines are stronger in the U.S.-Chile PTA, and U.S. industry will benefit additionally from a commitment to allow access to the market for local basic services—this is a commitment Chile does not currently hare under the WTO.
   __label__nonrel;  U.S. industry has expressed to USG officials appreciation for concluding a WTO plusAvvement on telecommunications that will hopefully move forward our agenda
   __label__ecommerce __label__usandpartners  The completion of the U.S.-Singapore and U.S.-Chile FTAs represents a ground breaking first step towards establishing a trade rules regime for electronic com merce that will prevent the erection of barriers to this new type of trade. The envi ronment for electronic commerce trade is currently free of unnecessary restrictions, and with the passage of these Agreements, we will be one step closer to maintaining a global commitment to continued openness in this space.
   __label__exports __label__smallbiz __label__iprights __label__dispute __label__transparency __label__govprocure __label__sector  The U.S. high-tech sector has a lot to gain from these FTAs, as well. Provisions relating to intellectual property rights protection, anti-competitive behavior, trans parency, government procurement and dispute settlement will make the Singapore and Chile markets more predictable for U.S. ICT and content exporters, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, zero tariffs will also allow U.S. suppliers of ICTs to better compete with domestic suppliers. Finally, telecom service providers stand to gain much through commitments that ensure open markets, non discriminatory network access, timely and cost-oriented interconnection, the ability to lease lines at reasonable rates and resell services, a transparent regulatory envi ronment, and industry-led standards setting.
 __label__outro;  Thank you Mr. -Chairman. I would be pleased to respond to any questions.
 __label__nonrel;  Mr. VARGO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   __label__intro;  American manufacturing is in a crisis, losing one out of every ten jobs in the last 2 years. Manufacturing has fared -much worse than the rest of the economy, and America's factory workers have ac counted for nearly 90 percent of the total job loss in the overall U.S. economy. Trade is a major reason for the crisis in manufac turing, particularly the loss of manufactured goods exports—which last year accounted for 75 percent of the total decline in U.S. man ufacturing production.
   __label__nonrel;  Two things must be done to restore a healthy trade position for U.S. firms: [1] the dollar must return to a more reasonable value—it was as much as 30 percent overvalued a year ago; and [2] we must level the global trading field to bring foreign trade barriers
   __label__forbarriersred __label__country  The Chile and Singapore free trade agreements are extremely significant in this regard, for they eliminate most trade barriers we now face in those markets. They also advance the, state-of-the-art in trade agreements and set a high standard for future agreements. Singapore and Chile are the most open countries in their respective parts of the world, and it was wise to negotiate these trend-setting agreements with them before moving on to other agreements.
   __label__position __label__ecommerce __label__growth __label__country __label__sector  The agreements benefit all sectors of the U.S. economy, importantly including services and e-commerce as well as manufacturing and farm products. The NAM urges the fastest possible -action to bring both the Chile and Singapore agreements into effect.
   __label__foragrees __label__exports __label__jobs __label__country  Passage of the Chile agreement on a timely basis is particularly important, as Chile's trade barriers are higher than Singapore's, and Chile has negotiated many free trade agreements with our competitors, most significantly with the European Union, our major competitor. The NAM estimates that our share Josses in Chile's markets are already costing us $1 billion a year, nearly $20 million each and every week. In job terms, the absence of an FTA with Chile is costing us about 13,000 lost job opportunities. That number will rise rapidly as Chile's new FTA with Europe takes business away from U.S. firms and hands it on a platter to our European competitors.
   __label__position __label__jobs __label__foragrees __label__exports;  Let me conclude by asking the subcommittee to serve as a spark plug in approving both the Chile and Singapore agreements. Let us focus on creating U.S. jobs. Delay only serves as an export pro motion program for our competitors.
 __label__nonrel;  Thank you.
    __label__intro;  Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am pleased to testify today on behalf of the National Association of Manufacturers on the significance of the re cently negotiated trade agreements with Chile and Singapore. The NAM represents 14,000 U.S. manufacturing companies, including 10,000 small and medium-sized firms. I know the subcommittee has particular interest inIservices and in E-com merce, and I will comment on those aspects of the agreements as part of my state 
    __label__nonrel __label__ sector  Representing American manufacturers, I can tell you that manufacturing feels under siege. More than 2 million American factory jobs have been lost in a little over two years—more than one in every ten jobs. Manufacturing lost more than 95,000 jobs last month alone.
    __label__nonrel __label__ sector  The current economic slowdown is essentially a manufacturing recession—a deep one. The rest of the economy, while not grnwing at its usual rate, has 'not felt the same pain as manufacturing. Manufacturing represents 14 percent of the American workforce, but has accounted for nearly 90 percent of all the job losses since total U.S. employment peaked in March 2001.
 __label__nonrel __label__ sector  While manufacturing employment has fallen more than 10 percent since that
   __label__nonrel __label__ sector  Trade is a key reason for this. Trade—both imports and exports—is much more important to manufacturing than to the rest of the economy. Trade has been a key factor in the current manufacturing recession—particularly the decline in U.S. man ufactured goods exports. These exports fell $30 billion last year, accounting for 75 percent of the total fall in U.S. manufacturing production in 2002. This is serious not just for manufacturing, but for the whole economy—for manufactured goods ac count for over 80 percent of all U.S. merchandise exports. Even when services are added in, manufactured goods are two-thirds of all U.S. exports of goods and serv ices.
   __label__nonrel __label__ sector  We face two key trade problems: the more recent problem is a seriously over valued dollar. After a decade of stability, the dollar started rising against other cur rencies in 1997, and peaked at an increase of 30 percent in February 2002—making U.S. exports 30 percent more expensive and imports up to 30 percent cheaper. This had a disastrous effect on our trade, which is why the NAM has led efforts to obtain a dollar policy based on market-determined exchange rates reflecting economic fun damentals.
   __label__nonrel;  The Administration began enunciating such a policy last year, and since then the dollar has moved about half-way back to normal levels. Major Asian countries, importantly including China and Japan, however, still manipulate their currencies in a way that keeps them weak against the dollar. This is not, strictly speaking, a matter for trade negotiations—although Trade Promotion Authority encourages the Administration to seek consultative mechanisms to examine whether foreign governments are engaged in currency manipulation to provide a competitive advantage in international trade.
   __label__nonrel;  The second problem—the long-standing asymmetry between our market openness and the trade barriers maintained by too many of our trading partners—is, however, very directly the goal of trade agreements. We need trade agreements to level the playing field and bring more foreign markets to the same degree of openness that the U.S. market offers. Most individuals do not realize, for example, that the average U.S. import duty is less than 2 percent, and that two-thirds of our merchandise imports enter the United States duty-free. U.S. merchandise exports to many countries, however, frequently face trade barriers equal to 20-30 percent tariffs or even more. This is particularly the case in the industrializing developing countries that account for about half our trade deficit.
   __label__position __label__ forbarriersred __label__ country  The NAM believes that trade agreements, such as the Chile and Singapore accords under consideration today, are vital tools for knocking down these foreign trade barriers. For this reason. we strongly support the speedy passage of both agreements. Let me explain the reasons for our support more fully, including discussing the contributions the two agreements make in the areas of services and e-commerce.
   __label__nonrel;  The two agreements are similar to each other, but are not identical—reflecting the different circumstances of U.S. trade with the two countries. My remarks attempt to avoid too much redundancy in discussing the two agreements, and the absence of a comment on one agreement but its inclusion in the other does not necessarily reflect a void in the agreement—merely a desire to minimize duplication of text.
   __label__foragrees __label__country;  Let me begin with the Chile agreement, for Chile provides a textbook example of why we need free trade agreements as fast as they can be negotiated—whether they be multilateral, regional, or bilateral. Until 1998 the United States typically had a 24 percent share of Chile's import market, meaning that Chile bought nearly one 
   __label__exports __label__foragrees __label__country  As the graphs attached to my statement show, starting a year after these agree ments went into effect, the U.S. share of Chile's import market began to fall precipi tously. Since 1997, U.S. exporters have lost nearly one-third of their share of Chile's imports. That's a lot. Moreover, as is also shown in the graphs, the United States did not have a comparable loss in other South American markets—meaning that something unusual was going on in Chile. The second graph shows why: the coun 
        __label__exports __label__jobs __label__country  This is not a trivial loss. In fact, the U.S. share loss in Chile works out to roughly     $1     billion of lost U.S. exports annually, worth about 13,000 American job opportunities. In other words, 13,000 additional Americans would be employed if we could recover our share loss. We are losing about $20 million a week—week in and week
   __label__foragrees __label__jobs __label__sector  Time is not on our side, for Chile's largest and most significant FTA just went into effect in February—a free trade agreement with the 15-member European Union (the EU). The EU is already Chile's largest supplier, and the new agreement is the biggest blow yet to American exporters. The NAM figures that if we don't eliminate the EU's advantage quickly, we are going to lose another 6,000 or so jobs.
   __label__exports __label__benchmark __label__country __label__world  Competition is very keen between U.S. and European firms, and every day that they have duty-free access to Chile while we don't is just one more day when we are simply giving American business to European firms. That is why the NAM urges that the U.S.-Chile FTA be moved forward as quickly as possible. The Chile FTA is an excellent deal for U.S. exporters. It not only provides market access into Chile, but also provides state-of-the-art disciplines for the bilateral trade relation ship. We also believe the agreement is a template for the broader regional negotia tion of the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__sector  The NAM's principal interest in the Chilean accord was in negotiating away Chile's across-the-board tariff on U.S. industrial exports. We are extremely pleased that the agreement does that. And it does it right away. The moment that agree ment goes into effect, tariffs on 85 percent of our exports to Chile evaporate in stantly_ This is a very significant accomplishment. It means that we will be back in the game right away, rather than waiting several years for tariff cuts to be phased in gradually.
   __label__tbts __label__usandpartners  In addition to tariff elimination, the FM also provides for improvements reducing non-tariff barriers, importantly including standards, conformity assessment provi sions, and other "technical barriers to trade" These types of barriers have always been difficult to identify and negotiate, and the Chile FTA provides an innovative bilateral committee to work on these issues and seek their reduction or elimination.
   __label__exports __label__fdi __label__transparency __label__sector  With respect to services, we believe the FTA provides new and broad market ac cess for U.S. services providers. It is also significant in that it contains state-of-the-art provisions that raise the bar for future agreements. The FTA applies to the cross border supply of services as well as the ability to make investments and build a services presence locally. This is reinforced by strengthened disciplines on regu latory transparency. Given the breadth of services accorded substantial market ac cess under the agreement's "negative list" approach, it appears that the agreement will provide broad opportunities for U.S. business in the services sector.
   __label__transparency __label__usandpartners  A particularly important feature of the agreement is its provision for greater "transparency" in domestic regulatory processes. Transparency in the regulatory process is essential for services industries because they tend to be among the most highly regulated. While the U.S. regulatory process is a very open and transparent one, the same is not always true in other countries. Chile committed to transparency steps that include designating a contact point for inquiries and problems, prompt publication of regulations, advance publication with opportunities to comment on prospective regulations, and independent tribunals or procedures for prompt review of administrative actions.
   __label__ecommerce __label__usandpartners  The e-commerce and digital products provisions provide ground-breaking advances that increase market access and provide increased recognition of the importance of this issue with regard to global trade and the principle of avoiding barriers that im pede the use of e-commerce. The FTA's guarantees of non-discrimination and its binding prohibition against customs duties on products delivered electronically cre ate a favorable environment for the development of increased e-commerce. The FTA also introduces the new concept of "digital products," providing greater predict ability of treatment for this important commercial channel.
   __label__iprights __label__usandpartners  The Chile agreement, similar to the Singapore agreement, also contains out standing provisions for protecting intellectual property—and is notable for its ad vancement of protections against counterfeit goods, as I discuss more fully in the Singapore section of my statements. Also, the Chile agreement contains excellent provisions for temporary entry of personnel and for investment guarantees. Both these are discussed more fully in the Singapore section.
   __label__growth __label__ alltrade __label__ fdi __label__ usandpartners  Let me turn now to the Singapore agreement. Like the agreement with Chile, the free-trade agreement (FTA) with Singapore is a comprehensive state-of-the-art agreement that benefits American firms and workers and also will help lead to greater regional and multilateral trade and investment liberalization efforts.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__ country  Singapore is already a very open market, and the agreement with Singapore not only solidifies that openness for American exporters of goods and services but also
   __label__alltrade __label__ growth __label__ usandpartners  Singapore is an advanced country that depends on shipping, finance, trading, and high technology manufacturing. It is a high-income country, with a per capita income of roughly $25,000—about the level of Europe. It is America's 8th largest export market and 12th largest supplier (counting the EU as a single entity). U.S. trade with Singapore in 2002 was in surplus by $1.4 billion, making Singapore one of the few countries with which there is a U.S. trade surplus. The FTA will further integrate our already-close commercial relationship and provides the basis for even faster two-way growth.
   __label__foragrees __label__ tbts __label__ partner  The agreement sets the foundation for the United States to preserve its market share as Singapore continues to move toward additional free trade agreements, in cluding with Japan, Canada, China and Korea. American farmers, workers and service providers would be at a distinct commercial disadvantage without the FTA. Notably, the Singapore agreement reduces the kinds of obstacles that particularly affect smaller U.S. goods and services producers seeking to trade with Singapore. It reduces physical presence and local investment requirements significantly; it eases customs and government procurement procedures; it facilitates electronic com merce and entry into services trade; and it establishes procedures for the elimi nation of technical barriers to trade.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__ sector  Given the pre-existing openness of Singapore's markets for goods, the most important market access gains in the FTA are those in the services area. The commitment to substantial market access across most services, with assurances of nondiscrim inatory treatment supported by greater regulatory transparency, provides a solid foundation for services trade liberalization. As in the case of the Chile agreement, Singapore committed to steps which lock in transparency, with advance notification provisions, appeal mechanisms, and the like.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__ sector  The agreement sets high standards for additional agreements to open services trade throughout the region. Particularly notable is that Singapore agreed to a "neg ative list" approach in which only designated services may be excepted—all other services are open, importantly including new service industries which may emerge in the future. This was an important break-through in a trade agreement with an Asian country.
   __label__tbts __label__ sector  In addition, the agreement's provision for temporary entry of personnel improves the ability of U.S. services firms to provide competitive services quickly. These pro visions also improve the competitiveness of U.S. firms by facilitating their ability to send technicians and other personnel to Singapore to maintain equipment and services sold there. The ability to move highly trained personnel quickly is particularly important in commerce with a high-technology country such as Singapore.
   __label__ecommerce __label__ country  Furthermore, the Singapore FTA's provisions on e-commerce and digital products provide a strong basis for the expansion of this important technology. The establishment of non-discrimination guarantees and a binding prohibition on customs duties on products delivered electronically create a favorable environment for the development of increased e-commerce. The accord also contains a precedent-setting provision that applies all services commitments to their electronic delivery.
   __label__fdi __label__ sector  The agreement also improves the investment climate and protections for U.S. in vestors in Singapore. As Singapore accounts for 60 percent of total U.S. manufac turing investment in all of Southeast Asia, the investment provisions of the FTA are extremely important. The provisions are also important for services industries. Foreign direct investment is one of the key ways by which U.S. service industries can function overseas, for many services can only be produced by having a presence in the foreign market.
   __label__iprights __label__ usandpartners  The NAM commends the FTA's high level of intellectual property protection, including state-of-the-art protection on trademarks and digital copyrights and expanded protection for patents and trade secrets. These are supported by tough penalties for piracy and counterfeiting, including seizure and destruction of products and equipment and mandated statutory and actual damages for violations. Singapore will sign on to global internet treaties, will extend the term of protection for copyrighted works, and will maintain criminal penalties for circumvention and for trade in counterfeit goods.
   __label__iprights __label__ usandpartners  The NAM is extremely concerned with the rising global level of trade in counterfeit goods. Earlier this year, our members set up a task force to address the issue of global counterfeiting—which not only costs U.S. production and jobs, but also affects health and safety through deluding consumers into purchasing substandard and unsafe products. We are therefore very pleased to note the strong provisions to combat such trade contained in the Singapore agreement. This includes giving effect to the trademark law treaty and joint recommendation on protection of well 
    __label__competition __label__ sector  With respect to the Singapore agreement, I would highlight one final area where the NAM worked particularly hard to achieve strong results. That is the area of competition policy. We pressed vigorously to have the Singapore ITA set the highest standards with regards to competition policy, so that the agreement would prohibit practices that unfairly restrict competition or unreasonably restrain imports.
    __label__competition __label__ usandpartners  We are very pleased, therefore, that the agreement contains provisions to protect U.S. firms against possible anti-competitive and monopolistic behavior by committing Singapore to enact laws regulating anti-competitive conduct, and creating a competition commission by January 2005. Especially important is the commitment that Government-Linked-Corporations (GLCs) will operate on a commercial, nondiscriminatory basis. As GLCs account for roughly half of Singapore's economic activity, this was an important accomplishment. Incorporation of these commitments was critical—not because of past Singaporean abuses (Singapore has maintained an open competitive environment)—but so as to provide assurances of future openness, as well as to build a template for agreements with other countries.
    __label__nonrel;  Both the Singapore and Chile FTA's are cutting-edge agreements that serve American commercial and foreign-policy interests toward those nations and as ex amples in their respective regions.
    __label__laborrights __label__environment __label__usandpartners   I want to add that both agreements break new ground in dealing with labor and environmental issues in FTA's. In our view the provisions of both agreements contribute to ensuring that parties to the trade agreements will enforce their labor and environmental laws so as to avoid a trade disadvantage to the United States, and do so in ways that will prevent these measures from becoming disguised protectionism.
    __label__outro __label__position;  The NAM believes these agreements are strongly in our trade interest, that they serve as excellent models for more trade agreements, and that they will benefit the economic growth and stability of both the United States and our trading partners. The NAM urges positive consideration of both agreements by the subcommittee and the committee, and rapid approval by the entire Congress.
 __label__nonrel;  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   __label__intro;  Mr. HOLLEYMAN. Mr. Chairman, Ms. Schakowsky and the mem bers of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.
   __label__nonrel;  My name is Robert Holleyman and I am President and CEO of the Business Software Alliance, an association of leading developers of commercial software, hardware and e-commerce technologies. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today on the significance of the Singapore and Chile Free Trade Agreements. The in formation technology is one of the leading contributors to the U.S. balance of trade. IT industries generated a trade surplus of $24.3 billion in 2002. IT also contributed $405 billion to the U.S. economy, 2.6 million jobs, and $342 billion in tax revenues in 2002.
   __label__exports __label__industry  Exports account for over 50 percent of revenues for most of the leading commercial software makers in the U.S. If we are to continue the positive contributions, U.S. trade agreements must establish an open trading environment that promotes strong intellectual property protection, growth in technology services„ and barrier free e-commerce.
   __label__position;  I am pleased to express the unequivocal support; of BSA and its member companies for the Singapore and Chile Free Trade Agree 
   __label__nonrel;  We commend Congress and the Administration for these achieve ments. And, without the leadership provided by Ambassador Zoellick and his team these achievements would not have been pos sible.
   __label__iprights __label__industry  Let me highlight some of the key provisions in the agreements. For the software industry, strong intellectual property protection is key in the fight against piracy, which cost the industry $11 billion in lost revenues last year. Indeed, piracy is the biggest trade bar rier we face in many markets. Both Singapore and Chile have pi racy rates of 51 percent, costing the industry $41 million in Singa pore and $59 million in Chile in 2002. Our trading partners must establish a high level of IP protection that complies with the WTO's Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the World Intellectual Property Organization's Copyright Treaty. The Singapore and Chile Agreements meet this test.
   __label__enforcement __label__partner  In addition, both agreements require strong civil and criminal enforcement regimes, which are critical elements in our fight against piracy.
   __label__nonrel;  Let me take a moment to discuss a few of the key elements of the provisions on Information Technology, another key negotiating objective for the U.S. During the past decade, a vast array of new technology services has proliferated, including data storage, web hosting and software implementation services. Technology users are increasingly purchasing IT solutions as a combination of goods and services.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__industry  As a result, obtaining full liberalization in this area is more im portant than ever. Both the Singapore and Chile agreements pro vide full market access and national treatment on IT services. Both agreements adopt a comprehensive approach without any excep tions for technology. This will provide evolving IT services with full market access today and into the future.
   __label__ecommerce __label__industry  We strongly commend this approach and result. Over 500 million people are using the Internet worldwide. The promotion of barrier free, cross border e-commerce is, therefore, critical to the technology industry. By 2005, two-thirds of all software is expected to be distributed online. This will provide U.S. software companies with enhanced access to markets around the world. The e-commerce chapters in both FTAs recognize, for the first time, the concept of "digital products." As we move to more online distribution of software, we will not face new barriers, and we will have the same ease of access that we had for traditional boxed software.
   __label__benchmark __label__country __label__world  With the conclusion of these FTAs we believe important precedents have been set for what the U.S. can achieve through the WTO Doha Round of negotiations. We believe that they set new standards that help the U.S. achieve these objectives.
   __label__jobs __label__country  In conclusion, the Singapore and Chile Agreements mark real milestones in progress for the technology industry, new baselines are set, this will open markets for U.S. technology companies which
 __label__outro;  Thank you.
    __label__intro;  Mr. Chairman, Ms. Schakowsky and the Members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. My name is Robert Holleyman and I am President and CEO of the Business Software Alliance (BSA). BSA is pleased to have the opportunity to testify today on the significance of the Singapore and Chile Free Trade Agreements.
    __label__nonrel;  BSA represents the world's leading developers of software, hardware and e-com merce technologies. As one of the leading contributors to the U.S. balance of trade, U.S. information technology (IT) and software makers have contributed a trade sur plus of $24.3 billion in 2002. As a leading engine of global economic growth the in dustry contributed a trillion dollars to the global economy in 2002. In the U.S`'. alone, the IT industry contributed $405 billion to the U.S. economy, creating 2.6 million jobs and generating $342 billion in tax revenues in 2002.
    __label__exports __label__iprights __label__ecommerce __label__sector  Exports account for over 50 percent of revenues for most of the leading commer cial software makers in the U.S., including the majority of BSA members. If we are to continue the positive contributions of this industry to the U.S. economy, it is crit ical that free trade agreements (FTAs) establish the highest standards of intellec tual property protection. It is also critical that FTAs provide an open trading envi ronment that promotes barrier free e-commerce and growth of the information tech nology services sector.
    __label__nonrel;  As the landscape of trade policy continues to evolve, two relatively new issues have emerged on the international scene that could have an impact on American software exports. A number of countries are now contemplating enacting preferences in their software procurement policies based on the method of software develop ment, which could have a severe impact on software exports, to the disadvantage of the American software industry. In addition, a number of countries, especially in Europe, are imposing levies (or surcharges) on hardware and software products, which by some industry estimates could cost up to one billion dollars per year, hurting both exports and the profitability of the American technology industry. Both issues should also be part of our nation's trade agenda.
    __label__position;  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to express the unequivocal support of BSA and its member companies for the Singapore and Chile Free Trade Agreements.
    __label__position;  BSA is also a member of the High Tech Coalition on FTAs, who also strongly sup port the FTAs.
    __label__iprights __label__ecommerce __label__usandpartners  These agreements significantly advance the establishment of strong intellectual property protection and barrier free e-commerce in Singapore and Chile, and we commend the Administration and Congress for these achievements. Without the leadership provided by Ambassador Zoellick and his team and Congress's thoughtful guidance these achievements would not have been possible.
    __label__process;  The importance of the Congressional approval of the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to the American high tech industry cannot be underestimated. The TPA legis lation set the standard of strong IP protection and trade liberalization among our trading partners in all trade contexts including FTAs and the World Trade Organi zation (V170).
    __label__ecommerce __label__alltrade __label__world  With the successful conclusion of these FTAs, and continued progress within the WTO Doha Round of negotiations, including important talks on e-commerce and trade in services, we feel confident that the U.S. will achieve its objectives in pro moting barrier free e-commerce and trade liberalization among our the world's trad ing partners.
    __label__nonrel;  For the software industry, strong intellectual property protection is essential in fostering continued innovation and investment as copyright infringements and soft ware piracy cost the industry $11 billion in lost revenues last year. In Singapore
    __label__nonrel;  To promote strong IP protection in a digital world, it is essential that our trading partners establish the level of copyright protection that complies with WTO Agree ment on the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty (WCT). It is also essential that our trading partners fully comply with and enforce these obligations.
    __label__iprights __label__enforcement __label__usandpartners  The mutual obligations under the U.S.-Singapore FTA mark some of the highest standards of intellectual property rights protection and enforcement yet achieved in a bilateral or multilateral agreement. The U.S.-Chile FTA also makes significant progress in achieving improved intellectual property protection and enforcement.
    __label__iprights __label__usandpartners  Both agreements recognize the importance of strong intellectual property rights protections in a digital trade environment by building on the obligations in the TRIPS Agreement, and ensuring that works made available in digital form receive commensurate protection by incorporating the obligations set out in the WIPO Copy right Treaty.
 __label__iprights __label__usandpartners  Some of the highlights in both agreements include:
    __label__nonrel;  During the past decade, a vast array of new e-commerce and information tech nology services have been developed including data storage and management, web hosting, and software implementation services. Given the increasing trend for tech nology users to purchase information technology solutions as a combination of goods and services, full liberalization in this area is more important than ever.
    __label__nonrel;  It is critical that our trading partners provide full market access and national treatment in information technology services including those that are delivered elec tronically. It is also important that no barriers are created for the-new and evolving information technology services.
    __label__forbarriersred;  In both the Singapore and Chile agreements, parties agreed to provide full market access and national treatment on services. Both agreements adopted a negative list approach, which means that new services will be covered under the agreement un less specific reservations were made in the agreement.
    __label__forbarriersred __label__industry  We commend this approach and the achievement in both agreements where liber alization of information technology services was achieved without any commercially
    __label__ecommerce __label__benchmark __label__industry __label__world  With over 500 million people using the Internet worldwide, the promotion of bar rier free cross border e-commerce is critical in encouraging continued e-commerce growth and development. In fact, the trade treatment of software delivered elec tronically is one of the most important issues facing the software industry and it is essential that software delivered electronically receive the same treatment under the trade laws as software traded on a physical medium. The e-commerce provisions in the Singapore and Chile FTAs should be the model for what the United States pursues in all future trade agreements.
    __label__nonrel;  We are quickly moving to a world where online distribution is the predominant way software is acquired and used. According to our CEOs, by 2005, 66 percent of all software is expected to be distributed online. This will have enormous efficiencies as the newest, most up-to-date software is delivered across borders at a lower cost and more quickly than when delivered in a physical form, to the benefit of both cus tomers and software developers.
    __label__ecommerce __label__forbarriersred __label__industry __label__usandpartners  The E-commerce chapters in both the Singapore and Chile FTAs recognize, for the first time, the concept of "digital products" in terms of trade. The chapters also es tablish requirements that further promote barrier free e-commerce, essential in pro moting growth and development of the IT industry.
 __label__iprights __label__ecommerce __label__forbarriersred __label__position;  In conclusion, the U.S. free trade agreements with Singapore and Chile mark milestones in progress toward the promotion of strong intellectual property rights protection, full liberalization of trade in information technology services and barrier free e-commerce among our trading partners. In these agreements, new baseline have been set that should lead to significant market opportunities for the US IT and software industries in the years ahead. We commend the achievements made in both agreements and we strongly support their passage in Congress. On behalf of the members of BSA, I would like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to testify here today.
   __label__intro;  Mr. WASKOW. Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today before the subcommittee concerning the Chile and Singapore agreements. My name is David Waskow, and I am the Trade Policy Coordinator with Friends of the Earth.
   __label__nonrel;  The Chile and Singapore agreements may be limited in economic terms, but they are significant when it comes to the environment. In the case of Chile, natural resources are at the heart of the coun try's trade: its four largest export sectors to the United States are fruit, mined products, forestry products, and fish, and the country has some of the most vulnerable and important forests in the world.
   __label__nonrel;  Singapore is known as a significant transportation corridor for environmentally sensitive trade, including endangered species and illegally logged timber.
   __label__benchmark __label__environment __label__usandpartners __label__world  But these agreements are significant beyond their direct environ mental implications, because they will set important and critical parameters for future agreements, such as CAFTA and the FTAA. Unfortunately, the precedents set in these agreements do not pro vide sufficient protection for the environment and could lead di rectly to the undermining of critical environmental laws and regu lations.
   __label__nonrel;  I will touch on three areas. First, the issue of investment. During debate over the Trade Act of 2002, many environmental and public interest groups and State and local lawmakers voiced our deep con cerns about the increasing number of cases under NAFTA Chapter 11. Using those rules, foreign investors have challenged and demanded compensation for environmental and public interest laws and regulations. And, we continue to stress that the investment rules of NAFTA provide investor rights that go far beyond those provided under U.S. law, and enable inappropriate challenges to our protections.
   __label__nonrel;  Congress, in response, required in the Trade Act that that investment provisions in future agreements "ensure that foreign investors are not accorded greater substantive rights than United States investors under U.S. Law."
   __label__dispute __label__fdi __label__usandpartners  Unfortunately, that standard has not been met in these agree ments. There have been some limited, very limited changes, and we would especially note the transparency requirements for the inves tor suit process itself, but at the end of the day this "no greater right standard" has not been achieved.
   __label__environment __label__usandpartners  Nor does the approach address the fundamental problems that environmental groups and others have identified with the NAFTA model.
   __label__nonrel;  Supreme Court principles have been inserted completely out of context, and the agreements also fail to include critical standards from U.S. law such as distinctions between land and personal property.
   __label__environment __label__fdi __label__usandpartners  Other critical elements of the investment chapters, including the definition of investment, do not comport with U.S. law, and there's no general environmental exception, and this is somewhat surprising given it's correct, as proponents of investment will say, that there's no threat to environmental laws, why not have a carve out for precisely those laws.
   __label__enforcement __label__usandpartners  Second, environmental provisions, as global trade increasingly integrates economies, we believe it is vital that the potential environmental impacts of increased trade be fully addressed. However, a plain reading of these agreements makes clear that the environmental provisions do not have the same enforcement provisions as for commercial terms, a step backwards from the Jordan Agreement.
   __label__enforcement __label__usandpartners  There is also no binding obligation on governments not to lower their environmental standards, but above all we are deeply dis appointed that these agreements lack any independent mechanism allowing citizens to bring complaints when governments fail to carry out their environmental obligations under these agreements.
   __label__environment __label__usandpartners  Third, services, and I will just mention briefly that we are concerned because a number of service sectors do have environmental consequences, transportation, energy, including pipelines, elec tricity and other activities, and water. These are not, perhaps, rel evant directly for these agreements, but will be for future agreements such as CAFTA and FTAA, and the precedents set here are troubling.
   __label__outro;  Let me conclude by saying that the Chile and Singapore agree ments are critical as potential precedents for future agreements. As negotiations progress on those agreements, it will be vital not to re peat the serious flaws in the Chile and Singapore agreements. Oth erwise, we believe that the United States will go down an unsustainable path in its trade policy.
 __label__nonrel;  Thank you.
 __label__intro;  Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee today on behalf of Friends of the Earth concerning the recently negotiated free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore. Friends of the Earth is a national environmental advo cacy organization. We founded and belong Friends of the Earth International, a net work of groups with more than one million members in 70 countries worldwide. Friends of the Earth has worked to address trade and environmental issues for many years, including serving on the U.S. government's Trade and Environment Policy Advisory Committee and, recently, the Industry Sector Advisory Committee on Chemicals and Allied Products.
   __label__nonrel;  The Chile and Singapore agreements may be limited in economic terms, but they are significant when it comes to the environment. Trade involving both of these countries has substantial international environmental implications. Natural re sources are at the heart of Chile's export trade: its four largest export sectors to the United States are edible fruits and nuts, mined products (copper), forestry and wood products, and fish and seafood. The Chilean forestry sector in particular is enor mously important. Both in scale and in diversity of species and ecosystems, Chilean native forests are irreplaceable on a global level. The primary temperate forests of Chile represent one-third of the remaining primary temperate forests in the world, and the United States was the largest purchaser of Chilean forestry products in 2000. A 1997 World Resources Institute report showed that 45 percent of Chile's original undisturbed forest already has been lost, while 76 percent of the remaining frontier forest is threatened.
   __label__nonrel;  Singapore is known as a significant transportation corridor for environmentally sensitive trade, including trade in endangered species, illegally logged and traded timber, and ozone depleting substances. Most notably, Singapore is a major hub for the laundering of illegal wildlife, particularly from Indonesia and Malaysia.— For example, Singapore is the major exporter of wild-caught sulphur-crested cockatoos, even though the birds' natural range is limited to Indonesia, a country that has pro hibited their export. In addition, authorities seized 6 tons of African elephant ivory being transshipped to Asia through Singapore in July 2002, though trade in ele phant ivory has been banned for more than a decade. A recent report has also indi cated that, during a ten-month period in 2001-2002, Singapore exported millions of dollars of illegal ramin, an internationally protected tree species, to the United States without the permits required by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).
   __label__benchmark __label__environment __label__usandpartners __label__world  However, the Chile and Singapore agreements are significant not only because of their direct implications for environmental concerns. They also serve to set critical parameters for future trade agreements, including future bilateral agreements and
   __label__nonrel;  During debate over the Trade Act of 2002, many members of Congress, including several on the Committee, raised significant concerns about the investment rules in Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). These rules provide private foreign investors the right to bring complaints before international arbitral tribunals when they believe that the investment provisions of the trade agreement have been violated. Environmental and public interest organizations and state and local lawmakers voiced concern about the increasing number of investment cases in which companies sought compensation for the effects of environmental and public interest laws and regulations. Mexico and Canada have each lost Chapter 11 cases involving environmental protections, and the United States has been challenged under Chapter 11 for such actions as California's phase-out of a toxic gasoline additive, MTBE. The consumer protection mandate of this Subcommittee is surely relevant to addressing the potential threat posed by such challenges.
   __label__dispute __label__fdi __label__usandpartners  We continue to stress that that the investment rules in NAFTA provide investor rights that go far beyond those provided in U.S. law and enable inappropriate challenges to be brought against government actions in the public interest. In response to heightened attention to these issues, Congress required in the Trade Act that investment provisions "ensuriel that foreign investors are not accorded greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than United States investors in the United States ..." Section 2102(b)(3).
   __label__transparency __label__fdi __label__usandpartners  The approach to international investment rules embodied in the Chile and Singapore agreements contains some incremental improvements over NAFTA's Chapter 11. We would especially note the transparency requirements for the investor suit process itself. We do not believe, however, that the provisions we have reviewed comply with the direction from Congress that new international investment rules not provide foreign investors with "greater substantive rights" than domestic investors enjoy under U.S. law. Nor does the approach address the fundamental problems that environmental groups and others have identified with the NAFTA model.
   __label__dispute __label__fdi __label__usandpartners  First, on the issue of expropriation, or takings, the inclusion of clarifications setting out a shared understanding of the expropriation, or takings, standard provides some incremental improvements. However, the clarifications fail to adequately reflect U.S. law in many respects, including the particular Supreme Court decision, Penn Central, on which USTR intended to base much of the standard in these agreements. The agreements focus on a limited and imbalanced set of the critical factors used by the Supreme Court in determining takings cases.
   __label__nonrel;  Simply listing some of the factors the Supreme Court discussed in the Penn Central case, but without the essential explanations and limitations that were set forth in that case and in subsequent rulings, provides no assurance that foreign investors will not in fact be_granted greater rights than U.S. investors. This failure to provide explanations and limitations for critical standards includes the use of the "character of government action" as a factor in expropriation analysis. "Character of government action" taken out of context is an extraordinarily ambiguous phrase and could easily be misapplied by tribunals that are neither trained in nor bound by U.S. precedent.
   __label__nonrel;  The agreements also fail to include critical standards established in U.S. jurisprudence. For example, they do not include the critical Supreme Court "parcel as a whole" principle that a governmental action must permanently interfere with a property in its entirety in order to meet a threshold requirement to constitute a taking. Property rights are not defined in the agreements, nor are there any reference to the fact that under Supreme Court cases takings claims must be based upon compensable property interests, which are defined by background principles of property and nuisance law. Furthermore, the agreements fail to include the fundamental distinction between land and "personal property" and the significantly different treatment that these categories of property have been afforded under U.S. law. In addi 
   __label__nonrel;  The agreements indicate that non-discriminatory regulatory actions to protect legitimate public welfare objectives do not constitute an indirect expropriation, or regulatory taking, except in rare circumstances. But while this language provides some direction for arbitral panels, it fails to adequately convey the degree to which it is unlikely that a regulatory action would be considered an expropriation under U.S. law. It would take an extreme—not just a rare—circumstance for any of the thousands of our country's laws and regulations to be found to constitute an expropriation. It would be more accurate to state that regulatory actions designed to protect health, environment, or the public welfare do not constitute an expropriation, except in instances equivalent to a permanent, compelled, physical occupation. Yet the agreements do not say this.
   __label__fdi __label__environment __label__partner  Other critical elements of the investment chapters also do not comport with standards under U.S. law. In regard to minimum, or general, treatment, we are deeply concerned that the standard is inherently subjective and incapable of precise definition and opens the door to wide-ranging interpretation by tribunals. For example, the tribunal decision in the Metaklad case under NAFTA Chapter 11 considered a local government's disagreement with the Mexican federal government over a permitting decision for a hazardous waste treatment facility to constitute a violation of this standard. While we welcome the clarification that the minimum treatment standard includes procedural due process, inclusion of one principle in a standard does not eliminate the significant potential of a broader, unbounded interpretation of the standard that goes far beyond U.S. law.
   __label__fdi __label__usandpartners  In addition, the definition of investment in these agreements differs markedly from that in NAFTA and appears to be even broader in scope. The definition is broad as to include protection of investments such as shares, stock, and other forms of equity; bonds, debentures, loans, and other debt instruments; and futures, options and other derivatives. The effect of this definition is not clear, but at a minimum it raises questions as to the types of property interests the agreement seeks to protect and whether those notions are consistent with the limited notion of protected property interests under the U.S. Constitution and case law.
   __label__dispute __label__usandpartners  The lack of an appellate process under the investment rules and the lack of any clear oversight role for U.S. courts inhibit the development of a clear jurisprudence consistent with U.S. investor protections. There can thus be no assurance that any of the substantive rights in these agreements will be applied in a manner consistent with the U.S. legal norms as required by the Trade Act.
   __label__environment;  We believe that the failure to include a general environmental exception to the investment chapter is a further indication that international investment rules remain a significant threat to environmental and other policies enacted by governments to further the public interest. If, as the supporters of strong investment protections argue, such rules pose no threat to legitimate environmental regulations or actions of government, then it is difficult to understand why it would not be appropriate to ensure that result by clearly carving out such regulations from the ambit of the rules. The agreements do so for other portions of the agreement, but not for investment.
   __label__capcontrols __label__country  We are also concerned by the transfer of funds obligations in the investment provisions of the Chile and Singapore agreements. These obligations, which were highly controversial and the cause of a substantial delay in the completion of the agreements, in most cases prohibit the use of capital controls to address financial crises. Capital controls are strongly endorsed by pro-trade economists such as Jagdish Bhagwati as a necessary tool to address global financial volatility. From an environmental viewpoint, the availability of such policy tools is important because financial instability and crises are generally not conducive to sustainable development policies.
   __label__nonrel;  Finally, we see the continuation of an imbalanced approach to the treatment of private multinational investors as opposed to citizens generally in international economic law. Investors are given explicit rights and enforcement mechanisms to hold governments accountable. On the other hand, as we will discuss below, there is no citizen enforcement mechanism included in either agreement—not even a process analogous to the NAFTA Commission for Environmental Cooperation citizen sub mission process.
 __label__environment;  As global trade increasingly integrates economies – a fact beyond the control of any of us here today – we believe it is vital that the potential environmental impacts of increased trade be fully addressed. We therefore believe that environmental concerns about the impacts of trade, in sectors ranging from forestry to transportation, should be treated jointly with the commercial issues addressed in trade agreements. The environmental community's longstanding position is that environmental provisions should have enforcement parity with commercial provisions and must be robust in improving environmental standards in the participating countries. We also believe that environmental provisions must include an effective process for citizens to bring complaints regarding environmental issues that are addressed in the agreement. Unfortunately, while the US-Chile and US-Singapore, include environmental provisions in their core text, they don't meet those tests and also represent steps backward from earlier agreements negotiated by the United States.
   __label__enforcement;  Most significantly, the agreements lack any independent citizen petition mechanism to address failures by countries to carry out their environmental commitments under the agreement. The failure to include any such process, even one similar to the process provided for in the NAFTA side agreement on the environment, the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), is a serious omission. The NAFTA procedures are inadequate and lack any clear and effective follow-through mechanism for enforcement. Yet, if nothing more, the framework has allowed some important environmental issues to be raised. For example, just last week, the attorneys general of New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island, along with 48 Canadian and United States non-governmental organizations and two towns in New York State, filed a citizen submission asserting that Canada is failing to effec tively enforce the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the federal Fisheries Act against Ontario Power Generation's (OPG) coal-fired power plants.
   __label__nonrel;  We believe that it is fundamentally imbalanced and inappropriate to omit a cit izen petition mechanism for environmental provisions when the investment rules in these agreements include a private right of action for foreign investors. Moreover, we believe this imbalance represents a failure to fulfill the Trade Act's mandate to seek equivalent dispute settlement mechanisms. An equivalent dispute mechanism for environmental provisions would grant citizens the right to bring environmental complaints with the same effectiveness as private investors are able to exercise under investor rights rules.
   __label__environment __label__partner   In addition, the Chile and Singapore agreements do not contain binding language to prohibit the countries involved from lowering their environmental standards outright. The countries have agreed merely to hortatory language that each party "strive to ensure that it does not waive or otherwise derogate from" its environmental standards. Yet even a country's failure to meet this "non-waiver or derogation" standard cannot be the basis for a dispute settlement proceeding under the agreements. This inability to address a violation of the "non-waiver or derogation" standard through a dispute settlement process makes these agreements a clear step backwards from the Jordan Free Trade Agreement, which allows for such disputes.
   __label__dispute __label__usandpartners  It is also quite clear on any plain reading of the agreements that the dispute mechanism for violations of environmental provisions is not equivalent in a number of respects to the dispute settlement process for commercial provisions. The agreements thus clearly fail to provide for parity of enforcement and thereby represent a clear step backward from the Jordan agreement, in which the dispute settlement rules did not distinguish among the agreement's provisions, and a departure from the requirements of the Trade Act.
   __label__enforcement;   Finally, it is vital to comment on the cooperative environmental arrangements that are tied to these agreements. These cooperative arrangements are included in the agreement in the case of Chile and are still being negotiated in the case of Singapore. While the aims that these cooperative arrangements aspire to are impor tant and very worthwhile, it seems extremely unlikely that these commitments will be at all effective in practice. Most important, the need for financial resources to realize the cooperative commitments has gone completely unaddressed by the U.S. government, nor has any consultation with Congress concerning funding issues taken place. U.S. agencies have even acknowledged that they lack the necessary re sources to carry out the cooperative programs agreed to in negotiations.
   __label__environment __label__sector  While services are not often considered to have impacts on the environment, the environmental implications of services negotiations are in fact quite substantial. Service sectors such as transportation, energy (including_ pipelines, electricity and other activities) and water all have important environmental ramifications. The NAFTA case involving cross-border trucking, which was decided largely under the agreement's services chapter, dramatically illustrates the environmental effects of such trade provisions. The recent decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals find 
    __label__nonrel;  In the Chile and Singapore agreements, the services chapters primarily address cross-border services. In the context of these agreements, then, the effects of the agreement for services such as cross-border land transport, pipelines, electricity dis tribution, and water distribution are limited. However, these agreements do set pa rameters for the services chapters in future agreements such as the CAFTA and FTAA where these concerns will be relevant. It is particularly troubling that the Singapore and Chile services chapters do not include an exception for "measures re lating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources, an exception that is found in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GAIT) and that the United States has relied on to defend U.S. law before INTO panels.
 __label__iprights __label__partner  The Singapore agreement does not include a critical exception found in Article
    __label__position __label__outro;  In conclusion, the Chile and Singapore agreements are important not only in their own right, but also as potential precedents for future agreements. As negotiations progress on other trade agreements, including a number of bilateral agreements and regional agreements such as the CAFTA and FTAA, it will be vital not to repeat the serious flaws in the Chile and Singapore agreements. The concerns that I have laid out here concerning investment rules, environmental provisions, services and intellectual property should all be fully addressed in future agreements. Indeed, lessons from the Chile and Singapore agreements and other past agreements can be built upon to construct a trade policy that is truly inclusive of environmental concerns. Otherwise, we believe that our country's trade policy will proceed down an unsustainable path.

As I understand them, the proposed Free Trade Agreements with Singapore and Chile offer many advantages that should facilitate trade in e-commerce and services for companies like ours. I would now like to give a brief overview and convey what I understand each agreement to mean for these sectors.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__country  Singapore is the United States' 11th largest trading partner, with two way trade valued at $33 billion annually. Singapore will guarantee zero tariffs immediately on all U.S. products, and will accord substantial market access across its entire service regime, subject to very few exceptions.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__fdi __label__sector  U.S. service firms will enjoy fair and non-discriminatory treatment through strong disciplines on both cross border supply of services and the right to invest and establish a local services presence.
   __label__iprights __label__usandpartners  Key intellectual property components are contained in the agreement, including the protection of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. Provisions also ensure government involvement resolving disputes between trademarks and Internet domain names.
   __label__nonrel;  Singapore also agreed to cooperate in preventing pirated and counterfeit goods from entering the U.S. Copyright provisions ensure that only authors, composers, and other copyright owners have the right to make their work available online. These provisions are extremely important to firms like ours in protecting software products from theft.
   __label__nonrel;  Of special important for firms in our industry, Singapore and the U.S. agreed to provisions on e-commerce that reflect the issues importance in global trade. The landmark electronic commerce chapter introduces the concept of digital products in trade agreements.
   __label__nonrel;  As well, for hard media products, such as DVD and compact disc, custom duties will be based on the value of the disc, rather than on the projected revenues from the sale of the content-based products.
   __label__iprights __label__usandpartners  The United States is Chile's largest trading partner with two way trade totaling $8.8 billion in 2001. Similar to the Singapore Agreement, the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement contains a high level of intellectual property rights protections that go further than previous free trade agreements.
   __label__ecommerce;  Chile also agreed to provisions on e-commerce that reflect the issues importance in global trade. These identify Chile as a leader in Latin America for the further development of electronic com merce.

We think the U.S. team did a great job negotiating strong provisions on services and e-commerce. These provisions will ensure that we have access to new markets by knocking down the artificial barriers that have locked us out Our competitors have been enjoying a free ride for too long. It is time for America to get back in the game.
   __label__intro;  Good morning, Chairman Stearns and Ranking Member Schakowsky and members of the House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection. My name is Ron Monford, and I am the President and Chief Executive Officer of Mind Over Machines, Inc. of Baltimore, Maryland.
   __label__nonrel;  I am here testifying on behalf of my company and the U.S. Chamber of Com merce, the world's largest business federation, representing more than three million businesses of every size, sector, and region. I am grateful to the Committee for the opportunity to testify at this hearing on the significance of the Singapore and Chile Free Trade Agreements, as they pertain to trade in services and e-commerce.
   __label__nonrel;  Mind Over Machines is a 16-year-old firm specializing in the development of custom and commercial software applications that are distributed throughout the United States and abroad. Our custom applications for the legal and corporate serv ices industries are used by most of the top U.S. law firms, scores of Fortune 1000 firms and thousands of small to mid-cap companies. Several of these products are used by clients in Canada, the Caribbean and Europe.

   __label__nonrel;  Further, we have developed web sites for firms in Switzerland and Japan, as well as web sites dedicated to the advance of international trade. Since September 2002, company executives have made three trips to China for the purpose of establishing trade relations with web development firms there. We will, this week, hopefully complete negotiations with a Chinese company to outsource the development of some of our software products in China.
   __label__nonrel;  Mind Over Machines is dedicated to increasing its business with foreign clients and partners and is excited about the opportunities that these two Free Trade Agreements will provide us.
   __label__nonrel;  I have personally been involved in foreign trade since 1967 and have been respon sible for establishing trade relations with firms in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica, The Dominican Republic, Jamaica and others. During the period of 1990 through 1995, I was active in the procurement of raw materials from Japan, Korea, South Africa and Europe, as well as the sale of U.S. made products to markets in Japan, Mexico and Canada.
   __label__ecommerce __label__growth __label__firm  I was an early participant in U.S. Customs rule 807 provisions dealing with duties on value added and later enjoyed the benefits of NAFTA provisions in trade with Mexico. These experiences have enabled me to witness first hand the benefits that can accrue to small and medium firms from favorable trade conditions. I firmly believe that the establishment of Free Trade Agreements with other countries is nec essary to enable these firms to grow and better compete in the national and global marketplace. The proposed Free Trade Agreements with Singapore and Chile offer many advantages that should facilitate trade in e-commerce and services for compa nies like ours. I would now like to give a brief overview and convey what I under stand each agreement to mean for the services and e-commerce sectors.
   __label__growth __label__jobs __label__sector  The United States' service industry accounts for over 80% of the Gross Domestic Product and employment in the United States, and contributes to the U.S. economy through creating jobs, improving R&D and strengthening our global competitive ness. Both the Chile and Singapore free trade agreements should improve market access to U.S. firms across different service sectors.
   __label__nonrel;  Singapore is the United States' eleventh largest trading partner, with two way trade valued at $33 billion annually. Over 1500 companies are operating in Singapore today, with over 300 of these having made Singapore their regional Asia-Pacific headquarters. Singapore guarantees zero tariffs immediately on all U.S. products and will accord substantial market access across its entire service regime, subject to very few exceptions. Singapore will treat U.S. services suppliers as well as its own suppliers or other foreign suppliers. U.S. services firms will enjoy fair and non discriminatory treatment through strong disciplines on both cross-border supply of services and the right to invest and establish a local services presence. Traditional market access to services is supplemented by strong and detailed disciplines on regulatory transparency. Regulatory authorities must use open and transparent administrative procedures, consult with interested parties before issues regulations, provide advance notice and comment periods for proposed rules, and publish all relations. The FTA's services chapter introduces the definition of Express Delivery Services (EDS), a goal of the U.S. EDS service providers. It is also the first time these services have been defined in a trade agreement. The FTA also contains important commitments by Singapore to prohibit cross-subsidization by postal authorities. Key intellectual property components are contained in the agreement, including the pro tection of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets, which are state of the art, going further than previous free trade agreements. In addition to the intellectual property components, the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade agreement will provide new access for U.S. e-commerce companies, telecommunications companies, securities firms, professionals, and banks.
   __label__nonrel;  The Singapore FTA will provide high-level intellectual property rights protection in the following areas: 1) trademarks (stronger protection for well-known marks), 2) copyrights, 3) patents, and 4) trade secrets. Provisions ensure government involvement in resolving disputes between trademarks and Internet domain names. Additional provisions streamline the trademark filing process by allowing applicants to use their own national patent-trademark offices for filing trademark applications. Singapore agreed to cooperate in preventing pirated and counterfeit goods from en tering the U.S. and to impose criminal penalties as an enforcement mechanism. Copyright provisions ensure that only authors, composers, and other copyright own ers have the right to make their work available online. Copyright owners maintain rights to temporary copies of their works on computers. Patent terms can also be extended to compensate for up-front administrative or regulatory delays in granting the original patent, consistent with U.S. practice. Further, the agreement mandates both statutory and actual damages under Singaporean law for IPR violations.
   __label__nonrel;  In addition to key intellectual property benefits, the agreement will provide a secure, predictable legal framework for U.S. investors operating in Singapore. All forms of investment are protected under the Agreement unless specifically exempted. U.S. investors are provided treatment as favorable as local Singaporean inves 
   __label__nonrel;  The professional service sector stands to benefit from the agreement as well. Under the FTA, Singapore agreed to reduce restrictions and provide enhanced market access for U.S. professional service firms (e.g., the agreement covers architectural and engineering and legal services sectors). For U.S. law firms, Singapore will loosen the requirements that firms must meet to participate in joint law ventures with local firms. Furthermore, Singapore also agreed to recognize law degrees granted by a limited number of American law schools for purposes of qualifying for the Singapore bar. For U.S. architectural and engineering firms, local ownership restrictions have been relaxed. When fully implemented, the agreement will provide improved market access for U.S. professional services firms and individuals in Singapore.
   __label__nonrel;  Under the FTA, Singapore will be obligated to open its telecom service market and allow for non-discriminatory access to its telecom network. U.S. firms will be given the rights to interconnect with Singapore's telecom networks, access telecom facilities, lease components and resell services. Also, the Singapore telecom regulatory authority will be required to make its rule-making transparent. For instance, it will be required to publish its interconnection agreements and service rates. The FTA also calls for the U.S. and Singapore to work on an arrangement that would mutually recognize each other's telecom equipment standards. The telecom chapter should lead to increased market access and help strengthen U.S. competitiveness in Singapore's telecom market.
   __label__nonrel;  Lastly, Singapore and the U.S. agreed to provisions on e-commerce that reflect the issue's importance in global trade, and the principle of avoiding barriers that impede the use of e-commerce. The landmark Electronic Commerce chapter in the FTA introduces the concept of "digital products" in trade agreements. Provisions in this chapter guarantee non-discrimination against products delivered electronically (software, video and text) and preclude customs duties from being applied on digital products delivered electronically (video and software downloads). For hard media products (DVD and CD), custom duties will be based on the value of the carrier me dium (e.g., the disc) rather than on the projected revenues from the sale of content-based products. The e-commerce text makes binding a number of e-commerce com mitments that are now only voluntary or temporary in the WTO.
   __label__exports __label__transparency __label__fdi __label__usandpartners  The United States is Chile's largest trading partner, with two-way trade totaling $8.8 billion in 2001. The commitments in services cover both the cross-border supply of services and the right to invest and establish a local services presence. Groundbreaking transparency rules ensure that service regulators operate fairly. Regulatory authorities must use open and transparent administrative procedures, consult with interested parties before issuing regulations, provide advance notice and comment periods for proposed rules, and publish all regulations. Chile will ac cord substantial market access across its entire services regime, subject to very few exceptions.
   __label__iprights __label__enforcement __label__usandpartners  Similar to the Singapore agreement, the U.S.-Chile FTA contains a high level of Intellectual Property rights protection. Protection of copyrights, patents, trade marks, and trade secrets go further than previous free trade agreements. Enforce ment of such rights is also enhanced under this agreement. Trademark provisions ensure government involvement in resolving disputes between trademarks and Internet domain names, which is important to prevent cyber squatting. Also, the trademark provisions apply the principle of the first to file for a trademark is grant ed the first right to use that name. Copyright provisions ensure that only authors, cosponsors and other copyright owners have the right to make their work available online. Copyright owners maintain rights to temporary copies of their works on com puters. Protections further ensure that governments only use legitimate computer software, thus setting a positive example for private users. Lastly, patent terms may be extended to compensate for up-front administrative or regulatory delays in grant ing the original patent consistent with U.S. practice.
   __label__nonrel;  The telecommunications provisions in the agreement will allow for an open and competitive market in which users of the telecom network are guaranteed reasonable and non-discriminatory access. This prevents local firms from having preferential access to telecom networks. U.S. phone companies will also obtain the right to interconnect with networks in Chile and non-discriminatory, cost-based rues. Additionally, U.S. firms seeking to build a physical network in Chile granted non-discriminatory access to facilities, such as telephone switches and submarine cable landing stations. U.S. firms will be able to lease elements of Chilean telecom net 
    __label__ecommerce __label__usandpartners  The United States and Chile agreed to provisions on e-commerce that reflect the issue's importance in global trade. Each country also recognizes the importance of supplying services by electronic means as a key part of a vibrant e-commerce environment. Chile and the U.S. committed to non-discriminatory treatment of digital products; agreed not to impose customs duties on such products and to cooperate in numerous policy areas related to e-commerce. For digital products delivered on hard media (DVDs and CDs), customs duties will be based on the value of the media, not on the value of the movie, music or software on disc. The e-commerce text identifies Chile as a leader in Latin America for the further development of electronic commerce.
    __label__fdi __label__dispute __label__usandpartners  Lastly, the Chile agreement contains important provisions that will benefit the investment sector. The agreement will establish a secure, predictable legal framework for U.S. investors operating in Chile. All forms of investment are protected under the agreement, such as enterprises, debt, concessions, contracts and intellectual property. U.S. investors enjoy in almost all circumstances the right to establish, acquire and operate investments in Chile on an equal footing with Chilean investors, and with investors of other countries, unless specifically stated otherwise. Investor rights are backed by impartial procedure for dispute settlement that is fully transparent.
    __label__smallbiz __label__exports __label__jobs __label__foragrees __label__country  In conclusion, both the Singapore and Chile Free Trade Agreements provide tremendous opportunity for small businesses like mine to expand our markets internationally and create jobs in this country.

    __label__outro;  Again, I appreciate the opportunity to testify before the Committee on this impor tant subject. I would be happy to answer any questions.
 __label__intro;  Mr. KELLY. Thank you very much.
   __label__nonrel;  Three quick things. One, we want to thank the President and Ambassador Zoellick for what they have done to get us this far.
   __label__position;  EIA has been supportive of not only any free trade, whether it's TPA, NAFTA, China WTO, this is critical to our industry, and we
   __label__nonrel;  The last thing I will say, there are always going to be problems in any agreement, just as you would negotiate with your family or
   __label__outro;  So, I will leave it at that and look forward to you guys coming back and having a discussion.
   __label__intro;  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mrs. Schakowsky and Members of the Committee for the opportunity to appear before you today and to provide the views of the Elec tronic Industnes Alliance (EIA) on the U.S.-Chile and the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). My name is Brian Kelly and I am EIA' Senior Vice President for Government Relations and Communications. EIA is a partnership of electronics and high-tech trade associations and companies that constitute more than 80 percent of the $430 billion electronics industry.
   __label__nonrel;  I want to begin by congratulating Ambassador Zoellick and his skilled team of ne gotiators for concluding these important trade agreements. Ambassador Zoellick is making great progress in implementing the far-sighted strategy that the Congress and the Administration laid out in the Trade Act of 2002.
   __label__position;  EIA was a leader in the fight last year to obtain Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)—the centerpiece of the 2002 Trade Act—and we are pleased to see the Ad ministration aggressively using this authority to open markets and eliminate trade barriers as quickly as possible. We hope that the Chile and Singapore FTAs are only the first of many important market-opening agreements reached using this grant of trade negotiating authority in order to further the cause of free trade, which bene fits EIA companies and the U.S. economy.
   __label__nonrel;  U.S. high-tech goods and services exported to Chile totaled $865 million in 2001 but, overall, the U.S. share of Chile's import market declined from 24% in 1997 to 16.6% in 2002. In part, this decline may be the result of Chile having concluded FTAs with other countries—notably, with the European Union (EU) and Canada. Signing the U.S.-Chile FTA will put American manufacturers on a level playing field with those in Europe looking for new markets in Chile and allow us to rebuild and gr.ow our market share in Chile.
   __label__nonrel;  EIA's member companies also recognize the tremendous opportunities presented by the U.S.-Singapore FTA. This FTA will be the first the United States has signed with an Asian nation, and it will send a message that the United States will pursue trade opportunities in this important region. More generally, bilateral agreements such as this one will signal our commitment to the region to foster stable economic and political ties. Singapore is an especially good place to start. The Heritage Foundation ranked Singapore second in the world in its rankings on economic freedom, and Singapore has a good track record for pursuing open trade. Its investment laws are generally clear and fair, and there is a strong history of protecting private prop erty rights.
   __label__jobs __label__industry  New and expanded trade opportunities are critical to the U.S. electronics industry. According to the U.S. Commerce Department's report, "U.S. Jobs From Exports," more than a third of the jobs in the Computers and Electronic Products Manufacturing Sector are supported by exports—this amounted to 603,000 jobs in 1997. In light of the challenges now faced exports—this the high-tech sector, which have resulted in a significant number of layoffs, securing and enhancing access to foreign markets is a priority for our industry. The U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore Ms can play an important role in building jobs in the electronics sector.
   __label__benchmark __label__world  Both of these agreements will have benefits beyond the countries involved. It is especially noteworthy the Chile FTA would mark the first time that a major South American country has embraced the duty reduction commitments reflected in the 1996 Information Technology Agreement, although it has not signed the rm. Broad ening the pool of countries that are prepared to eliminate tariffs on IT products should be a major priority for U.S. trade negotiators. Hopefully, the Chile agreement will pave the way for similar commitments by other countries, especially in Latin America.

   __label__iprights;  Intellectual Property Protection. We appreciate the agreements' strong protection for copyrighted works that would facilitate the growth of digital technologies and products while still protecting the legitimate rights of copyright owners, reflecting the balance struck in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Moreover, strong en forcement provisions criminalize end-user piracy and commit Chile and Singapore to seize, forfeit and destroy counterfeit and pirated goods and the equipment used to produce them. These protections will apply to goods-in-transit and mandate both statutory and actual damages under Chilean and Singaporean law for violations of intellectual property rights.
   __label__forbarriersred __label__sector  Telecommunications. The Chile and Singapore FTAs provide for open markets and non-discriminatory access to telecommunications networks. We strongly support af firmation of the principle of technology choice by public telecommunications service providers. We are particularly pleased that specific provisions in the Singapore agreement have been included to ensure national treatment among service pro viders, protection against anti-competitive behavior and transparency in licensing procedures. These and other provisions will contribute to open and transparent tele communications markets for both service providers and equipment providers.

When the U.S. enters into these FTAs, it will grant Singaporean and Chilean companies better access to the U.S. market than their neighbors enjoy. Rather than hinder trade, however, we believe that this will lead other countries in both regions to seek similar FTAs with the United States. This will create a competition toward trade liberalization that will help reach our goals of zero tariffs, more secure trade, and increased transparency.
   __label__nonrel;  The FTA with Singapore will put U.S. manufacturers back on a competitive play ing field in Singapore and erase the disadvantage they currently face because Singa pore already has FrAs with New Zealand, Japan, the European Free Trade Associa tion and Australia. Talks aimed at new FTAs are also underway between Singapore and Mexico, Canada, ASEAN countries, China, Korea and India. It is important that the United States secure its place in the Singapore market.
